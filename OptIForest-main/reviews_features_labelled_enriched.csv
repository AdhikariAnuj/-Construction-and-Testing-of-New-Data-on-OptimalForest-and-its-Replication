208333264,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"Helldivers 2 used to be one of the most fun and chaotic co-op games I’ve ever played. Jumping in with friends, experimenting with loadouts, and laughing through the chaos was pure gold. But over time, update after update, that fun has slowly been stripped away.The game has had its ups and downs, but lately it’s been nothing but downhill. The fun keeps getting nerfed, the pain keeps getting buffed. What used to be a sandbox for creativity has become a rigid meta where only a handful of guns and armours are worth using.The Warbond system could’ve been great, but now it’s just a cosmetic treadmill. Every new “content drop” brings more bugs, more broken objectives, and more frustration. Silent enemies, clipping through walls, unkillable mobs, game crashes — they’ve all become a regular part of the experience. New enemies feel rushed and badly balanced, with no real counterplay or logic behind their design. With so much variety in weapons, stratagems, and armour, you’d think there’d be a coherent system tying it all together… but there just isn’t anymore. What’s worse is that there was a time when it felt like the devs listened, like they cared about making the game better but not anymore. At this point, it’s sad to see how far this game has fallen. I really loved Helldivers 2 and wanted it to succeed, but I can’t recommend it in its current state. If you’re looking for the game that once brought so many players together in chaotic, hilarious freedom — it’s gone.",1482,256,0.0128205128205128,0.0236167341430499,0,0,0,1,0,0.0663059163059163,0.4945189070189069,0,11,0,0,1.0,11,0,0,0,9,54,257.03333333333336,0.1666666666666666,257.03333333333336,0,0,0,0,5.765789132408248,0.0006484243288808,0,4.759876543209877,0.1666666666666666,1,1762193316,1762193316,0,0,0,0,1,0,546,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

Wow, where to start?

Are you a fan of D&D and roleplay?

Have you been looking for a game to grind out with friends and laugh while doing it?

Do you want to prove you’ve got what it takes to sweat like the sweatiest of try-hards?

Have you been searching for a community that welcomes cadets (newbies) with open arms?

Well, look no further, my new brothers and sisters — your new home awaits right here on Super Earth!

This is where legends are forged in the fires of our galactic war!
Where courage and conviction elevate you beyond mere citizenry — to Super Citizen!

Let Lady Liberty guide your hands, new recruit, and trust that those who’ve fought since release to bring you this masterclass in gaming — Helldivers 2 — will continue to stand by your side for a greater galaxy! Where the white, yellow, and blue banners of Managed Democracy fly high across every last star!

If you haven’t already gathered by now: I absolutely LOVE THIS GAME.

It isn’t without faults, sure — but let’s be honest with ourselves, what game isn’t? What game is impervious to nitpicking or critique?

I want to be absolutely fair and brutally honest with anyone on the fence: this game has broken before, and it will break again. I can almost guarantee it. The devs at Arrowhead couldn’t have possibly anticipated the amount of hype this game has generated. Practically overnight, it’s become a pop culture phenomenon — and with that comes the strain of massive player surges, server issues, and the challenge of maintaining a game built on a completely dead engine that’s currently being held together with Super Earth justice glue and Freedom-tape!

But despite all that, the real ones — those who see the heart of this game — have stuck by it through thick and thin. I’m proud to count myself among those who’ve been here since Day One.

Don’t let my Steam hours fool you — I started on PlayStation, maxed out my character, fought in every war, and bought it again on PC just to relive the experience from a newcomer’s perspective. Because let’s be real: once you’ve unlocked everything as a day-one player, there’s not much new content until the next Warbond drops. But even so — what a time to join the game!

Right now, new players are welcomed by 17 Warbonds packed with pages of gear, weapons, stratagems, emotes — the works. You’re stepping into a fully fleshed-out universe, rich with history shaped entirely by the community’s collective actions in the galactic war. There are three factions of enemies, each with subtypes and unique strategies to discover, weaknesses to exploit, and plenty of ways to spread that sweet, sweet LIBER-TEA!

And for my fellow hardcore roleplayers — this game even has a War Map that, once you learn how to read it, opens a whole new level of immersion. I’m not just talking about planning your next mission — I’m talking about joining fleets on Discord, analyzing Joel’s plans, deciding which anchor planets to defend to protect vital supply lines, and coordinating where to deploy democracy space stations like a true commander.

Did I mention I love this game?

Helldivers 2 has genuinely become a part of my life in an incredible way, and I want others to experience that too. It’s rare for a studio to make a game with this much passion, detail, and love for their community.

I want this game to succeed not just because I’m a hardcore fan, but because studios like Arrowhead deserve to set the standard for the industry. We need to stop rewarding the big, soulless corporations that shovel out copy-paste slop filled with microtransactions and “live service” nonsense. Stop paying for $20 skins after a $70–$100 entry fee — and start supporting studios that give you a full experience out of the gate.

If you need a simple reason to pull the trigger, here it is:

HELLDIVERS 2 is $40 — and you can unlock everything for free, just by playing the game.

If this were E3 1995, that right there would be the PS2 price-tag mic drop moment.

So what are you doing right now, citizen?
Buy the game. Suit up.
Join me in some drops new recruit!

Now for the sad part
-Game might crash, stutter, and/or freeze for a random number of seconds at any given time, sometimes all three in one matchmaking game
- Noise Bug making it so that you don't get audio or partial audio
- Sometimes you get randomly stuck on dead enemies bodies or just the environment and you have to kill yourself to get unstuck
-Sometimes you die to invisible fire?????
-Game Studio does shady stuff like shadow nerfs and promising to fix issues that have been a problem since launch day (like the random crashes)
-Dragon Roach spawn rates are still crazy frequent even after the patch to drop the spawn rate (shrug another empty promise)
-some weapons just aren't fun and aren't in the ""meta"" so its hard to play in higher difficulty levels

Overall this is a fun game but with all the technical issues and the lack of trust I have for and the empty promises/lies from ArrowHead, I have had enough of it until these problems are fixed. For example I just played a match where everyone had a freeze and after waiting 7 seconds it went back to normal but everyone else either left or crashed and I was the only one in the match in the middle of completing a mission (I just left the match soon after). I'm just tired of playing this game and will play other games, till things are fixed.",1609,293,0.0167806090739589,0.0093225605966438,0,5,0,1,0,-0.0462433862433862,0.4272751322751321,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,2,0,149.3,2.6666666666666665,149.3,0,1,1,1,10.776959142665772,0.0178611297164545,0,149.3,2.0,1,1762151030,1762151030,0,1,0,0,2,0,545,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

208283707,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,Currently i would not recommend this game to anyone. Game used to be fun no real game breaking bugs felt balanced. When the developers started to put underground bug caverns started to see over whelming waves of bugs and you don't have access to drops for resources or respawn team mates. Along with these additions were random game freezes/crashes.  Currently kept getting error codes 340/170 but there were servers down for a lot of game hosting. I waited till the next day when those server came back up and no more anti-cheat issues/ connection issues.  They talk of balance i don't see it. Most Developers start with a shaky foundation and expect what they build from that to be stable.,691,120,0.0130246020260492,0.0115774240231548,0,0,0,1,0,-0.127037037037037,0.3437037037037037,0,4,0,0,1.0,4,0,0,0,2,0,256.3666666666667,16.95,256.53333333333336,0,1,1,1,2.695358210895852,0.0660732848232848,0,256.53333333333336,2.0,1,1762134288,1762134288,0,1,0,0,2,0,545,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

However. the developers have seemed to turn to churning out update after update without ACTUAL playtesting or legitimate bug fixes. things said to have been tweaked in devlogs are either not changed at all or changed to NEGATIVELY impact the game. Getting tossed around over and over again with no chance to retaliate even Right AFTER dropping gets very tiring and over all just makes anyone not want to play anymore. Armor values seems to mean absolutely nothing as with heavy armor you move slower and have less stamina but still get two shot by common terminids like standard warriors as if you were wearing Light Armor instead. This is still a great game. but It feels more and more like the devs are just tossing shit at the wall and not even fixing what any of it breaks or even TESTING to see if their tweaks have actually changed anything before they lob it out in a ""Bugfix"" patch. Take your chances on it how you like, but ultimately I am very dissapointed and if things keep going this way, I dont imagine i'll be a dedicated diver much longer.",1190,216,0.034453781512605,0.0100840336134453,0,0,0,1,0,0.0277182539682539,0.5038293650793652,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,13,0,855.1,33.35,859.35,0,0,1,0,1.3916500994035783,0.0388084016989585,0,859.35,13.0,1,1762131131,1762131131,0,1,0,0,1,0,545,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

Intense, gripping combat, a massive variety of cool weapons and equipment to play with, a grounded aesthetic, and epic moments.
Add in an ever-evolving story that players can rally around, excellent crossover content that maintains the game's identity, and the Arrowhead team's responsiveness and ongoing attention to the players' thoughts, and this is a game I could play for years.
I especially appreciate that I don't feel like I have to spend additional money to keep up with the meta or chase limited-time items like in other games. They keep the starting gear viable even once you've leveled up.
But the reason I keep coming back to Helldivers 2 is the challenge of each new mission and loadout combo, the epic moments that the game continually produces, and the memories I make playing with friends.",866,145,0.0150115473441108,0.0173210161662817,0,0,0,2,0,0.0918449197860962,0.581149732620321,1,2,0,0,1.0,2,0,0,0,1,0,366.45,0.55,366.45,0,1,1,1,2.363214626824942,0.0015008868877063,0,366.45,1.0,1,1762123866,1762123866,0,0,0,0,3,0,545,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

I love this game a lot and the general gameplay loop, although kinda boring when you get the same MO over and over agiain, is still one of the most fun games ive played in a long time.
However, the game in its current state is almost unlplayable, if its not a crash every time theres more then 20 enemies, its getting crazy frame drops no matter what. When I first got this game I played it at ultra settings on an ARC B580, so not the best gpu but it got over 100 fps. Recently, though, ive barely gotten over 20 fps, and that didnt change when moving to medium or even low settings. The game has also grown exponentially since I bought it, as its now well over 100 gigs, and is moving very quickly to 150.
So, unfourtunately, I dont recommend Helldivers in its current state, no matter how much I want to.",908,176,0.0231277533039647,0.0231277533039647,0,0,0,1,0,0.0242424242424242,0.4208333333333333,0,2,0,0,1.0,2,0,0,0,1,0,53.06666666666667,0.0,53.06666666666667,0,1,1,1,17.110552763819094,0.0,0,53.06666666666667,1.0,1,1762112838,1762112838,0,1,0,0,2,0,545,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY SPREAD DEMOCRACY INTO THE UNJUST.



If you firmly believe that every living matter even bacteria is able to comprehend and live by the non-negotiable principles OF DEMOCRACY.



Then by no means, you should be stunned on your journey to the TERMINIDS *UNDERGROUND HIVES* if : 


- The evacuation shuttle stays out of reach and stuck on the surrounding structures.


- If the infinite labyrinth hive walls are time-penalizing you on your way to efficiently spread DEMOCRACY.


- If you always getting a curious horde of TERMINIDS from all ages and professions, coming to you, for you to explain to them, on how on super earth, you have been able to spread DEMOCRACY, with only your unwavering will and your flamethrower?


- if you feel that your stratagems ""use"" is no more ""useful"", as a faithful citizen of super earth, you knew, that is of course on purpose, you remembered, that on the 27 October in the year 2225, the freedom scientists were so adamant and declared that the only and true way to spread REAL UNDERGROUND DEMOCRACY is trough courage, no digging-pods and that you should report any dwarf who thinks otherwise.  



THEN AND ONLY, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND........ THE UNJUST.

208237254,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"This game is cinematic, and interesting, and unfortunately, more frustrating than anything else.  I've been playing since the beginning and I've reached a point where playing it for any length of time makes me quit mid-mission in disgust.  All practicing and mastering the game did was expose how often you get killed at random by terrible mechanics and game-breaking bugs.  The Developer has this delusion about whats fun in a game is being helpless and impotent.  They call it ""grunt fantasy"" and talk about the ""science"" of their balancing.  Balancing where the starter weapons are just as effective as anything you can spend hours earning access to.  Where invisible walls hold you down or ricochet your weapons back into your helpless corpse.  Where enemies don't even get weakpoints or have so much health you can't even bother fighting them, or pop out of the ground mid-attack you can only avoid with very specific loadouts.  There are so many weapons in the game that just dont really work or make sense and go completely unused because of the strict requirements these unreasonable ""grunt fantasy"" conditions force on you.  Balancing that makes a meta where only one of the hundreds of possible gear combinations might work. Recoilless rifle/Supply pack, thermite grenades, ultimatum.  Yawn.  It's really sad because this game looks awesome and wants to be played.  It wants to be popular.  It wants to not need an emergency balance patch every few months.  But the reality is, for every die hard fan who wants to debate this sort of complaint, there are 10 who just silently move on to a more fun game.  You can't debate this, you have to just make the game fun to play.  Grunt Fantasy is an oxymoron, I don't know who doesn't understand this at Errorhead but it is going to run your game into the ground.",1816,310,0.013215859030837,0.0154185022026431,0,0,0,1,0,-0.0084688346883468,0.4315379403794036,0,8,0,0,1.0,8,0,0,1,4,0,655.2333333333333,31.65,655.2333333333333,0,1,1,1,2.7715317698529787,0.048303403367757,0,655.2333333333333,4.0,1,1762098698,1762098698,0,1,0,0,2,0,545,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

Arrowhead has tried their darndest to throw us bones here and there for flavor, and it is difficult to maintain balance on such a large prospect of a game with 10 difficulties.

They fucked it.

It is now a seasonal, battle-pass-changes-everything game that no longer resembles what I originally encountered from launch into a year plus of playing. The reasons your character dies are no longer your own fault. It tirelessly punishes you for trying to do anything single-player. It immediately brutalizes you for trying to grind your face on the ""Major Order"". It's not fun. Roleplay has its limits. I'm not a teenager with 13+ hours to spend gettin' gud anymore. Your character isn't supposed to be an invincible super-hero, but they sure as fuck aren't supposed to be made of rice paper, and those delicious guns you spent days farming credits, samples, and upgrades over sure as shit shouldn't feel like confetti with a fully upgraded Helldiver and loadout.

Arrowhead, I've given well over $100 in super-credits because I indeed had FOMO, plus the supporter money from launch for a full-priced game. I've got my play-time out of this game, but then you made it end-of-life obsolete for me by making the same fucking game unplayable by the sheer mechanics you promised players so many times, so heartily you'd change.

I'm getting off this roller coaster, I thank you for the lolz, but I can no longer enjoy playing in a kids sand box if I scraped together 40 minutes out of my adult working life, or getting absolutely dick-punched if I touch the difficulty modifier up one or two ticks to ""fully-unlock"" the HD2 experience.

208227381,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"This is one of the greatest game's I've ever played, unfortunately it feels like every update makes it worse. Rupture Strain is back and it is genuinely just not fun. I feel like a hero dropping my exosuit and tearing apart the enemies during the last stretch of the mission, now just to have it be blown up 3 seconds later by a charger that burrowed underground and appeared 3 feet from my face; just one aspect of the disgusting difficulty increase that Rupture Strain adds, even on level 6 which I was playing on.

Gameguard anti-cheat has also been known as invasive and, from what I've heard, ineffective. If the only point is to deter less dedicated cheaters, something like EasyAnticheat would work just as well.

And, from what I've seen, the moderators at major lines of communication such as the Helldivers2 Discord and  r/Helldivers2 have been incredibly aggressive when it comes to silencing complaints; which, while in spirit of the lore of the game, is distasteful and frustrating.

I've been mostly ignoring all of this and continuing to play the game, but until Rupture Strain is either reworked again or removed entirely, I'm not sure it's even worth the 140GB it takes up.

This brings me to my final point; the game takes up 140GB of space, and takes unusually long to download to a HDD despite their claims of the size being for ""HDD Optimization."" This leaves you needing to dedicate 140GB of space to your SSD, assuming you have one.

In conclusion, this is still a great game and has the potential to be one of the best, but only if the developers prioritize giving the players a challenging but enjoyable experience.

I will change my review at such a time that they do, but for now they seem dead set on making the game progressively less fun to play, while slowing increasing the download size and destroying performance, all while Gameguard has total access to your computer.",1902,332,0.0226077812828601,0.0173501577287066,0,0,0,7,0,-0.0030982905982905,0.5330484330484331,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,7,0,126.25,18.4,126.25,0,0,1,1,15.065346534653465,0.1457425742574257,0,126.25,7.0,1,1762091424,1762091424,0,1,0,0,1,0,545,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

Helldivers 2 is a game, developed by people, played by people, published by companies. 

The game itself is so much fun. The publishers sometimes made dumb decisions to meet their own profit goals. Inconsequential because the game itself is so much fun. The developers are actively engaged with the game community and bring regular updates, fixes, etc. 

Experiment with all the different weapons, strategems, equipment, armor, etc. 
And then you find a combination that fits your unique playstyle. So much fun in the chaos. 
And then you encounter a mission or an enemy where that stuff doesn't work as well.
So then you adapt and try a new strategy. And hopefully that works. Learning is fun. 
There are a LOT of weapons/strategems/equipment to try out. I still haven't tried all of them.

If you keep dying on a higher difficulty, there's no shame in lowering the difficulty so you can calmly learn the strategies that work on the tougher enemies. When the ""Into the Unjust"" expansion released, I hated the Hive Lord and had no idea how to kill the Dragonroach. The Rupture Bugs are a fucking menace too. So I dropped the difficulty until I learned how to [kind of] deal with the new enemies.

One of the best parts of the game is the opportunity to have epic moments. They'll arise and you'll be clutch, or you won't. Your teammate can pull off some amazing feat and save your ass. Or, they won't. It's fun and chaotic and scary and fun and epic and funny. 

Bottom line, GREAT game.

208212412,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"Started playing with friends last summer. I've been enjoying this a lot. Difficulty doesn't make you do less damage to enemies but instead spawns in more different types of enemies and puts more challenging objectives on the map for you to conquer, to the point where the highest difficulty is not such a sweat fest once you've gone through learning the game on the lower difficulties first and unlocked appropriate weapons / stratagems to deal with different challenges.

I heard this game supposedly is ""ruined"" every second patch but I was having a great time even though I started playing during one of these ""ruined"" patches.

Final tip to anyone playing on the highest difficulty, don't be a lazy coward who runs immediately to extraction with plenty of reinforcement available. Hunt down all the objectives and outposts on the map. Thankfully this is not a problem for most players I've encountered. It is great to see the game isn't ruined by bad players.",967,163,0.0113753877973112,0.0103412616339193,0,0,0,1,0,0.1207729468599034,0.5140096618357488,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,70,530,133.15,20.05,135.88333333333333,0,0,0,0,7.262485918137439,0.1475530479578069,0,0.2563836477987421,0.1320754716981132,1,1762078090,1762078090,0,1,0,0,1,0,544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

208194663,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"I have over 800 hours in this game. I loved this game for quite a while, but with the changes that have been made recently, I just can't recommend it. I'll try my best to give it an honest review, though.

The Good:
1) Community: The community for this game is awesome. I've yet to see another community like Helldivers 2. Doesn't matter if you have friends in the game or not, you can always find a cool group of people to play with.
2) Unique Tactical Choices: At this point in the game, there are so many loadout options that you can get really creative with how you approach obstacles. It's fun make loadouts that work for everything. It's also fun to abandon what you're used to, make a totally wacky loadout, and then figure out how to make it work when you hit the ground. The mechanics are creative and fun (when they work).
3) Unique Missions: The game does a great job of making every mission feel singular. I have never played on the same map twice. I have solo'd level 6 missions. I have had my but kicked on a level 3 mission. (I'll come back to this point later, actually)
4) Fun in Groups: If you and your friends like extraction shooters, this game is almost always a good time as long as you don't take it too seriously.
5) Active Live Service: Arrow Head studios has (until recently: it sounds like they've taken a break from releasing new content to address some technical debt) been pretty consistent at adding new content to the game (I will also return to this point later). You can gain access to the new content by buying Super Credits, but you can also just get super credits by playing the game. Arrow Head has my respect for working against the greed of the industry and allowing players to access everything just by playing their game. Huge W for AH studios in my opinion. 

The Bad:
1) Continuing from point 3 above - Game Balance: There is literally no way to tell what is going to happen next in this game. In some ways, this is a cool characteristic of the game. In other ways, it's extremely frustrating. The balance of the game feels like it is constantly shifting. Sometimes it feels like the Devs don't even know what going on. I'm not talking about the story of the game, I'm talking about the gameplay and mechanics of the game. It feels unstable. One day a weapon works. The next day the Devs have nerfed it (sometimes without saying anything). One day an enemy type is a challenging obstacle. The next day you're avoiding planets entirely because that unit *might* be there.
2) Discontinued Game Engine: If you take anything away from this review, make sure it's this: AH studios built Helldivers 2 in game engine called Autodesk Stingray. This game engine has been discontinued since 2018. I don't think the engine has official support anymore, which means whenever something breaks AH Studios has to figure out how to fix it on their own. Game stability has consistently become worse and worse. This is a massive problem because...
3) Continuing from point 5 above - New Content: Every time Arrow Head studios adds something to this game, they somehow break EVERYTHING ELSE. I don't think that they test their new content in a ""to scale"" manner. I don't know what kind of spaghetti code their hiding under the hood of this game, and at this point I'm afraid to ask.
4) Pointless Mechanics: There are certain mechanics in this game that feel frustratingly pointless. I will use armor rating as an example. The game offers 3 armor tiers: light, medium, and heavy. Light offers the least protection and the greatest movement speed, Medium is in the middle for both, etc. You would think that this further builds on point 2 in the Good section above, adding even more variety to loadouts, right? Not quite. There is basically no reason to wear heavy armor. A lot of the time there is no reason to wear medium armor either. Let's use the Terminids as our example enemy. There is a standard Terminid unit called a Warrior. Wearing medium armor, a warrior can kill you in two hits. Normally, you'd think: ""Okay, so medium armor prevents you from dying immediately. That means the armor works right?"" No. Warriors can make two attacks almost simultaneously. If you don't either predict a warrior's attack and react before it happens or get lucky, your dead. If you're wearing heavy armor (depending on which set) you may survive with enough health to see the next attack coming. Even so, you aren't guaranteed to survive... which is the entire point of heavy armor. In other words, it probably would have been better to wear light armor and run away. Pretty much anything can be instant death in this game. I often wonder why they even have a health bar. For most of the game your health bar will be in one of two positions: 0% or 100%.
5) The Game Devs: It feels like the Devs want you to suffer sometimes. They love nerfing things. They've mentioned that they want to get rid of the meta and make all weapons/stratagems equally useful, but instead they just keep making everything more useless. It takes all the fun out of the game at times.
6) Cheating Players: There are no repercussions for cheating. The Devs removed the players' ability to report other people for cheating. Some people say that you can report cheaters through a specific support channel on the Arrow Head website, but I haven't been able to find it.

Tangent: The best way to describe this game is that it's more difficult than it was designed to be. If you complain about the difficulty in this game, be ready for the brain dead side of the community to bombard you with ""get good"" and ""play easier mission then, noob"". Normally, I'd say that's a reasonable response, but there is actually a decent amount of content you'll never see in this game if you don't play on harder difficulties. Further, even ""easy"" missions aren't guaranteed to be easier. For some reason certain missions will be way harder than normal with higher enemy spawn rates than there should be. I don't know if this is an intentional game mechanic or a bug that has never been addressed. Sometimes me and a friend can complete level 6's and level 7's with relative ease. Other days, a team of 4 will fail to complete a single objective on a level 5 mission. There's a huge difference between ""Wow, this game is difficult"" and ""I wonder if the level 5 mission is going to feel like a level 8 mission today"". Like, if I run off on my own on a level 10 mission with no supplies and a horde of enemies following me and I die, that's one thing. But sometimes I'll be playing a level 3 mission with a good loadout on a low-resistance planet and die 3 times because of circumstances that were completely out of my control, because the enemy spawn rate was randomly set to WUMBO, or because enemies started behaving in ways they shouldn't have.

When you die in a game because of something that was your fault, that's fine. Learn, improve, continue forward. But when you have over 800 hours in the game and that experience means absolutely nothing? When none of the game mechanics are consistent, and every death feels like it was outside of your control? What then? It's grating. It sucks because I REALLY want to love this game, but lately it's just made me want to crash out and rage quit because the game is so unnecessarily abrasive.

Is the game worth it? Bottom Line: If you buy this game, you probably won't regret it. I'd say it's easy enough to get at least $40 worth of entertainment out of this title. However- with the game in its current condition- I can't say that I recommend it. If you crave a challenge give it a try. Be ready for instability and crashes. Be ready for the odds to be against you. You're going to die a lot. A large portion of those deaths will be outside of your control. AH has been doing a lot of work on this game lately, so I'll keep my eye on things and maybe update this review later.",7898,1432,0.0254494808812357,0.0213978222334768,0,6,0,6,0,0.0560798072894846,0.4776570427780103,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,2,162,808.7,12.716666666666669,808.7,0,1,0,0,9.766291579077532,0.0157248258521907,0,4.991975308641976,0.0123456790123456,1,1762056908,1762056908,0,1,0,0,1,0,544,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

Unless you play around Difficulty 4-6ish then nothing really matters in that part. Fortunately you can still play the game and get enjoyment out of it. But it isn't for my duo and I. 

I might change the review if they fixed some more things too namely, I gave it an honest chance at least. Lots of laughs, lots of clipping through the ground, some cool moments.

208172315,553850,Helldivers 2,bombing,recent_all,"A great game developed by a studio completely incapable of handling its success that prefers to listen to its own opinion instead of listening their players.

I have almost 500h on the game, and I'll start listening the positives:
- Basically impossible to not have a game that is not cinematic. Almost any moment in the game could easily be a cutscene
- Glorious OST, no other way to describe it
- Currently one of the best looking games on the market
- Explosions and guns both sound and look great
- Difficulty spanning from ""i just want to mindlessly shoot"" to ""wtf is happening right now""

And now onto the negatives:
- Weapon balancing
- Performance
- Enemy design
- Bugs
- Co-op features design

But the biggest issues of all, is how the studio is managing all these negatives, that over time have been raised by the player base. To sum up their approach: ""I know what you want, you don't"". 
I understand some issues are the consequences of the game being planned for a smaller playerbase. Still, the reality is that the game sold a ton, a lot of people like it, and they like something that is VERY different from what the intended vision of the devs was. The devs told multiple times the game was/is supposed to be a grunge fantasy, that ""a game for everyone is a game for no-one"", that the power fantasy that its intro and trailer sells was supposed to be a joke that you realize playing the game.
To me that's a bunch of nonsense. Everything about the game screams power fantasy, the trailer sold a power fantasy, and people bought it for a power fantasy. And for the past two years that devs have been pin pong-ing between what their users wants, and what they wants. 
People find things they enjoy, the devs find a way to nerf it. In the last patch they got to the point were the community was basically begging to not touch a recent weapons, and they still decided to nerf it, WITHOUT WRITING ON THE PATCH NOTES. Makes you wonder if they think people are stupid. 
People complained of performance issues since last december, of the balooning game size, and they decided to ignore it and continue pumping out content until they got to a point were the crashes were making the game unplayable for a lot of people.

The studio just follow its plans, ignores player feedback 9 of 10 times, and then for that one time rushes to fix. And then the cycle repeats. 
It's basically a meme in the community that this game has cycles of ""it's done"" and ""we are so back"". 

If you want to feel like you have the power to fight an entire army just by yourself, it's the best game at giving you that feeling. If you buy into the lore, and find the right people to play it, it becomes one of the best games ever made. But that time you'll have an issue with performance, or an enemy design, or mechanic, don't expect the devs to listen to you. You are just a passive consumer of their product, and for that, I cannot recommend it.",2953,542,0.024381984422621,0.0176092109718929,0,0,0,1,0,-0.0389880952380952,0.4483619047619047,0,9,0,0,1.0,9,0,1,0,8,166,492.31666666666666,1.933333333333333,492.31666666666666,0,0,0,0,5.998171908324588,0.0039270117471816,0,2.9657630522088354,0.0481927710843373,1,1762034454,1762034454,0,1,0,0,0,0,544,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,630945,136282,8,Very Positive,630945,136282

I, however, no longer love the gameplay, the enemies, or the Devs. They nerf the weapons that work, buff the enemies when they don't need to, and worst of all lied to us about it. I thought Arrowhead was one of the better ones out there, but I see they don't care about this community or this game. Each gun either feels the same, or isn't worth being used. Enemies have gotten so rough that factions I used to love to fight became a chore to do. The Major Orders haven't been fun for a long time now. And they keep changing things for the sake of balance but it either does nothing but take up more storage space making the game chug or crash, or it makes it seem like we are stepping backwards when it comes to gameplay. I hope the ones that stick around have the best in the war.

The world is massive, beautifully crafted, and full of secrets that reward curiosity.
Combat is challenging but fair, giving a true sense of accomplishment with every victory.
The variety of weapons, spells, and builds lets you create a playstyle that feels completely your own.
Exploration is endlessly rewarding — every hidden path or dungeon can lead to epic loot or a tough boss fight.
The bosses are memorable and intimidating, and defeating them is genuinely thrilling.
NPCs and lore are woven into the world in a way that makes every encounter meaningful.
Multiplayer features like co-op and PvP add even more depth and replayability.
The game encourages experimentation and creativity, whether in combat, exploration, or character builds.
If you enjoy challenging, immersive worlds where every step feels earned, Elden Ring is an absolute must-play.",925,148,0.0194594594594594,0.0237837837837837,0,0,0,1,0,0.2878306878306879,0.7269841269841271,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,20,0,115.51666666666668,0.0,115.51666666666668,0,0,1,0,8.007502524888183,0.0,0,115.51666666666668,20.0,1,1761851942,1761851942,0,1,0,0,2,0,1340,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,511047,33091,8,Very Positive,511047,33091

What once might have been friction or tedium in lesser games is here transformed into a seamless, exhilarating flow, where every action and decision hums with brilliance. The world itself anticipates the player, shaping challenges and opportunities with audacious foresight and daring ambition.

Elden Ring doesn’t just surpass the old Souls games - it obliterates them with effortless, godlike mastery, a shining monument to what games can be. 

This is the undisputed apex of human game design. Pack it up. Go home. Give up. Nothing else can even compete.

took me longer to defeat Margit than it took me to defeat soul of cider in ds3

the game really holds your hand when compared to Dark Souls, especially on the runbacks. i don't think DS runbacks are as bad as people say tbh (perhaps Bed of Chaos, but that boss fight is ass so everything sucks there), but elden ring literally puts bonfires right beside the bosses. I made the decision to play the three Dark Souls games before jumping into Elden Ring, and oh boy i couldn't have made a better decision.",516,97,0.0232558139534883,0.0135658914728682,0,0,0,2,0,-0.0614285714285714,0.5402380952380953,1,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,1,1,194,613,18.766666666666666,18.933333333333334,20.8,0,0,0,0,27.4955595026643,0.9102564102564102,0,0.0339314845024469,0.3164763458401305,0,1761799852,1762191002,1,1,0,0,1,0,1339,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,511047,33091,8,Very Positive,511047,33091

It was extremely addicting, but so very worth it. It deserves all the credit it got. Are there some things I think the devs should bend on, like difficulty levels? Absolutely! Everyone deserves a chance to see this world and they are only doing themselves injustice by alienating those who won't be able to enjoy it due to the difficulty.

Every area feels alive, whether you’re creeping through shadowy caves or wandering into towering castles that make you stop and stare.

The combat? It’s brutal, sure, but it always feels fair. Boss fights are wild — you’ll probably curse a lot, but beating one actually feels like you accomplished something. The best part, though, is how you can explore any way you want. No hand-holding, no annoying arrows telling you where to go. Just real, honest adventure.

Yeah, sometimes it’s tough. But that challenge makes every discovery and victory mean more. The music, the world, the whole vibe — it just grabs you. Elden Ring isn’t just another game.

To be honest, it can feel quite confusing and discouraging at the beginning but if you could grin your teeth through the difficult moments, the game is actually pretty enjoyable and it gives you a sense of fulfilment when you come back to an enemy that has trashed you at first and you manage to be competitive and eventually overcome it.  

So far, I have no idea what the hell is happening story-wise - it's pretty confusing. However, the world, the music is breath-taking so it's not difficult to keep on playing just because of that. I strongly believe that as more pieces of the story get revealed, I'll enjoy it even more.",697,126,0.0114777618364418,0.0172166427546628,0,0,0,1,0,0.1324074074074074,0.6111111111111112,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,1,32,0,15.7,31.816666666666663,31.816666666666663,0,0,1,0,44.39490445859873,1.0,0,31.816666666666663,32.0,0,1761614119,1761614119,0,0,0,0,3,0,1337,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,511047,33091,8,Very Positive,511047,33091

Although, I dont like how the game doesnt tell what to do at all. You get a brief overview of what you can do and what the basics are, but as a beginner who has never touched a fromsoftware game, it can be quite frustrating. The first time that I have played this game, I didnt know what to do at all and stopped playing very quick. After around 2 years, I decided to give it another chance and overcome my past obstacles. With the help of the internet i found my issues and finally found my way into the game. It gets very adictive after some time and is a very unique and great experience.

207694505,1245620,ELDEN RING,bombing,recent_all,"Elden Ring is the rare open world that trusts you. Curiosity is the best stat here—wander off the road and you’ll stumble into dungeons, dragons, and secrets that reshape your build and playstyle. Combat is elastic and expressive: from spellblades and bleed monsters to chunky greatshield tanks, the build variety is wild without feeling gimmicky. The art direction swings from melancholy ruins to nightmare majesty, and it’s unforgettable.

Exploration and initiative are constantly rewarded—knowledge, not just numbers, is your power curve. It’s challenging, yes, but fair in that FromSoftware way that turns setbacks into lore and routing lessons. Simply put: the most generous, surprising, and cohesive take on Souls design to date.

Verdict: The best Souls game ever—vast, intoxicating, and endlessly replayable.",817,122,0.0171358629130966,0.0281517747858017,0,0,0,3,0,0.3041666666666666,0.5522486772486773,1,2,0,0,1.0,2,0,0,0,54,0,43.03333333333333,0.0,43.03333333333333,0,0,1,0,18.98528272656856,0.0,0,43.03333333333333,54.0,1,1761539683,1761539683,0,1,0,0,1,0,1336,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,511047,33091,8,Very Positive,511047,33091

Elden Ring is truly a gem of a product, and one that will keep bringing you make for hours upon hours.

I do think the game can be a bit large for many people. In many other open worlds, I wouldn't think this is a problem, but Elden Ring has so much in it's world. But not only that, since it still can be a bit cryptic with how you moving quest lines along or how to get to certain areas, it can absolutely feel daunting.

This is my second playthrough and I feel much better about this now then my first playthrough. Not only more comfortable with the gameplay and bosses, but being able to traverse the world better. While I didn't know where everything was, it was much easier being able to gauge where things were since I'd played this before.

With that said, it will only effect a small group of people. The rest, well, you have an unbelievably incredible product here. One that you can keep coming back to again-and-again for more. There truly isn't much left to say when talking about this game. Once you play it, you will be entranced and pulled into the world From Software has created once again.",1192,221,0.0201342281879194,0.0209731543624161,0,0,0,1,0,0.1949507389162561,0.5188697318007663,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,131,0,43.85,0.45,43.85,0,0,1,0,27.18358038768529,0.0102622576966932,0,43.85,131.0,1,1761531321,1761531321,0,1,0,0,2,0,1336,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,511047,33091,8,Very Positive,511047,33091

207680336,1245620,ELDEN RING,bombing,recent_all,"Overall Score: 7/10
Story: 5/10 Story is probably decent, but it never caught my attention, and i half speed ran the start of the game to play with friends missing out of character development etc. 
Gameplay: 9/10 Super solid and consistent gameplay, high difficulty, high challenge but also high rewards.
Graphics: 9/10 The environment, characters and just everything is pretty and looks great.
Solo VS Online: 5/10 Playing this game solo is fun, if you have the mimic tear to assist with boss fights. It's a shame like all souls games the coop portion is pretty terrible. You have to use consumables, stand in specific areas and can wait up to 5 minutes for the signs to spawn in. Just janky, if they can improve it to be similar to the Remnant games etc.

207675426,1245620,ELDEN RING,bombing,recent_all,"Horrendous game. Stylish and pretty with some of the most horrid mechanics of ANY game I've played. Every Single Enemy has AOE's that are either A. Unavoidable or last an arbitrary amount of time unable for you do deal damage to, Flying enemies unable to be hit unless you're using a specific weapon ( in which case this goes against EVERYTHING ) every other Souls game did where you should and could use EVERY weapon and it be viable. Not here. Want to use Fist weapons? you'll never land a hit on anything that flies at any point. Want to try do some roll playing and sneaking around to do some cheap critical hits? have fun during boss fights. Want to challenge yourself and use ONLY consumables? can't do that either since you can only hold so many of 1 item at a time. Buffs don't last over 60 seconds where fights with bosses and demi-bosses can last over 5x - 10x that amount of time. add in the AOE fiasco that every enemy can do and maneuver during their ""I'm going to enrage so don't come near me for 20 seconds ) makes them feel underwhelming and useless. Many late game bosses have this issue not just the early game. The copying and pasting of bosses in the game can make some sense to a degree, but there are literal areas just filled with what you fought somewhere 1 on 1 and now you have to 1 v 6 them. it's lazy, uninteresting and no-one goes out of their way to fight them. This game is literally marathon simulator, run past everything go to the next area to get your upgrade materials then go back since leveling your actual stats outside of Vigor, Endurance and Mind have little on how much damage you deal. Oh you wanted to maybe change your build mid way through then change it back? well you have to play though an entire area first unlike in DS2 you can do it immediately at the start of the game. I've never heard anyone say they enjoy fighting enemies like the Ulcerated Tree Spirits, Fighting 2 or more Crystallid Warriors or Crucible Knights ( even though if you just blaze through the game with max upgraded weapons or as far as you can get them they're not horrible ). Bosses should be just that ""Bosses"" not just something you copy and paste like 15 other enemies in the game and just be like here you go, we ran out of ideas just stick something in it. As someone who's put 1000+ hours into DS1 and DS2 and a couple of hundred in DS3 back on Xbox 360 this game is exactly what every bad thing about all of those games was and put into this one. Poise means nothing and weight means everything. Heavy armor is worthless and serves no purpose but to slow you down. Got headbutted by a 3 foot tall plant? Literally wearing stone as armor enjoy being stun locked and losing 20% of your health since damage reduction is % based you can't tell me that 1.6% of 1500 damage has any difference than 3.2% of 1500 damage means you're going to live or die in a boss fight that's going to take 10 minutes anyway ( i'll do the math here for you, it's less than 50 overall damage that you'd receive ) ( every dragon in the game follows this principle ). People that have praised this game are deluded in game and world design. Beat the game and i'll never touch it again dropped it a year ago back in august and picked it up after some tweaks were made came back ran a train on everything then you get to the last 5 - 6 bosses you can encounter where it's a 10 - 15 minute kite festival trying to squeeze in a hit without getting punished for it. Save your money and your sanity. stay far away it.

For someone older, who struggles with an open world game that is TOO OPEN, this combination of linear story with an incredible open world setting really hits it for me. Reminds me of RDR2 in that sense. 

The story is incredible, the choices that you make as you play are super important and it really feels like everyone gets a different experience. 

The menu and navigation takes a bit to get used to and the cyberware system definitely required a bit of a read up but once you understand it, it is a really unique aspect of an RPG. 

The soundtrack is amazing and atmospheric, the combat is slick and fun, honestly it is a 10/10 game and an absolute MUST PLAY",874,162,0.0320366132723112,0.0148741418764302,0,0,0,1,0,0.1391666666666666,0.5380555555555555,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,3,1,6,0,81.23333333333333,9.5,83.05,0,0,1,1,10.759130077964713,0.1143889223359422,0,83.05,6.0,1,1762186481,1762186481,0,1,0,0,3,0,1786,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

I let a few years to pass, and reading comments about how they fixed the issues, improved various things about the game, that made me hate it.

I finally decided to pull the trigger and give the game a chance, while still being doubtful. Damn.. The first time the game starts you realise we are talking about some serious bizz here, I was hooked right away.

The graphics, sound, game play, and most importantly, the story - All 10/10. This turned out to be one of the best games I've ever played, just started playing 2nd time from the beginning as there are so many things you can do differently, with different story lines, etc.

208302405,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Wanna clarify that I've only finished about 2 of the base game endings and have a ton of other side gigs left to do. I also have a degree of bias due to being pretty involved in the punk scene already. Even then, I still HAVE to recommend this. I have never felt so embraced by such a unique, stunning world with a wild cast of characters. 
Combat never felt too boring, even with me going for a simple 'blunt object' build. I do wish the better rewards for missions didn't feel so based in stealth, but I think it's encouraged me to do a netrunner playthrough next. And even when I didn't want to start a fight, just driving around the city with the radio on was enough. 
Regarding the narrative, Night City will give you the exact amount of immersion you want, provided you're willing to give it time to build up steam. Once you cross that line, it's hard not to get sucked in. And without giving anything away in the plot, you will constantly be questioning your moral code. Every ending has its caveat. Every character will have their impact.
My journey started getting a bit buggy towards the end, but otherwise it ran pretty smoothly. Most issues ended up being in regards to driving (AutoDrive would fail to start properly unless I rebooted the game, or my car would clip through the ground). Other simple bugs involved missing audio during dialogue. Still annoying, but honestly, I'm impressed it took 50 hours to even see a single bug. Everything was smooth before that.
Considering how terrible this game supposedly was at launch, the fact that the game is doing this well today is genuinely impressive. It 100% has a place within my top 5 favorite games of all time.

208299939,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Ultimately hints a very good lesson on the overview of life, immortality, the fleeting dream.
To seek freedom, implies the state of captivity. 

The entire world generally feels alive and immersive. The design aesthetics and whole live city is visually spectacular.
The characters are memorable, for good or bad... the people are as crazy as would be expected in a godless society.
There are no rules in the city and anything can happen. Trust is hard to build where lies beget truth. True survival of the fittest atmosphere. Everyone looks out for themselves and figuring out if there's a purpose, meaning. or evolution to their existence in a pyramid city where anything is possible. Without giving any real spoiler, one eventually finds the entire thing extremely dystopian and depressing. But then again that's up to how you want to interpret your story....

Combat is intriguing and unpredictable op at times. It may be familiar to Fallout series combat, but this is much more invested. (however, shared similar clunk animations)

A downside is no aliens/bio species even though in the future.
Biggest downside is playing as a named character, so there's a lack of personal touch.

Hard scale rating: an 80 out of 100 (Legendary tier)

208262566,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Finally got Cyberpunk when it was randomly on sale in late 2025... really happy I picked it up. It's fantastic, and there's not a whole lot of of bugs or jank left in the game. A very fun experience with lots of still novel concepts, despite being ~5 years old.

I enjoy that there are actually multiple ways to approach situations depending on your skill distribution, without fully locking you out of doing anything. Would be pretty awful to hardlock you out of certain quests/objectives if you didn't have strength of an arbitrary threshold to bash in a door -- the game offers a path regardless of your build, which is nice. Those alternate paths are also not just side-by-side BS ""options"" (e.g., hack the access panel that is right next to the door you can break that is next to a vent you can stealthily enter)... there's slightly more detouring involved around each option, to the point where you have to seek out the option that jives with your build.

Weapons mechanics are solid, especially with the tech / power / smart dynamics, though I feel like diversity of guns is skewed towards pistols / SMGs / Assault rifles mainly... would have loved a wider range offering of precision & sniper rifles. Shotguns are actually well represented with double barrel, semi-auto, and heavy variants. Tech weapons feel a bit underwhelming, but that just might be due to my current build.

World feels very full & immersive, and has pretty good exploration -- you get locked into the initial area/district for the first prologue portion of the game, and then it eventually opens up the rest of the map. I like that you unlock fast travel points via proximity rather than having to actively click on them. I don't like the pacing of certain quests where it's locked around ""xyz will call you later after you've done more side gigs / missions"".

I've put in 100+ hours within a month of buying, so I think that speaks for itself.

Running a 7950X3D, 7900XT, and 32 gb RAM @ 1440p... ultra settings across the board, with the exception of ray tracing. I'm using whatever AMD frame generation stuff is default.

208262163,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Cyberpunk 2077 Review 
Gameplay
*  Massive overhaul in Update 2.0 — combat, perks, and cyberware feel fresh and balanced.
* Gunplay is tight and responsive; melee finally feels impactful.
* Hacking system is deeper and more tactical — rewarding stealth players.
* Vehicle combat and police chases add excitement missing from the original launch.
* Builds matter now — you can truly feel the difference between Netrunner, Solo, or Tech builds.

 World & Exploration
* Night City is breathtaking — dense, detailed, and alive with atmosphere.
* NPCs and crowds behave more realistically after updates.
* Side missions and gigs often rival main quests in writing and world-building quality.
* Vertical design (rooftops, alleys, interiors) encourages exploration like never before.

Story & Characters
* V’s story remains emotional and personal — full of tough choices.
*  Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) is charismatic and complex.
* Multiple endings still hit hard — now with more context and improved pacing.

Performance & Graphics
* Major technical improvements — stable, optimized, and smooth on PC & consoles.
* Ray tracing + DLSS 3.5 (PC) make visuals stunning.
*  Most bugs and crashes are gone; gameplay is consistent.
* Feels truly *next-gen* now — not the broken launch version from 2020.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a messy miracle — a broken launch turned into one of the most atmospheric, story-rich RPGs of the decade.

Night City feels alive in ways few worlds do: neon-lit streets, desperate voices, dreams and decay in equal measure. Performances are stellar, quests meaningful, and choices cut deep.

The combat finally matches the fantasy: guns feel powerful, cyber-abilities open creativity, and stealth is deadly when built right.

It’s gritty, stylish, and human beneath the chrome.
If you play for story and worldbuilding, this is one of the greats.",628,102,0.0238853503184713,0.0334394904458598,0,0,0,5,2,0.0567857142857142,0.4792857142857142,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,80,164,1108.0,0.0,1108.0,0,0,0,0,0.5667870036101083,0.0,0,6.7560975609756095,0.4878048780487805,1,1762107359,1762107359,0,1,0,0,1,0,1785,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

May 2025 I finally forced myself to start a playthrough and oh boy was I positively surprised. This is truly one of the best games I've experienced in my life. The sounds and looks of the city were just what I would have expected a futuristic city to sound and look like. Gameplay was interesting, character builds had diversity and the story was captivating. I enjoyed every minute of the game and 100%:ed the game including achievements. 

The story made me feel and think. I was immersed in the game world it and felt the weight of responsibility for the decisions I made.

208192068,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"After playing this game for quite some time, I can easily say this game is a masterpiece. The game has truly come a long way since release back in 2020. The main story is one of the most engaging, immersive and emotional experiences I’ve personally experienced in gaming. Every choice feels meaningful, every mission pushes you deeper into the world of Night City weather its a story mission or side quest/gig. The writing just hits different and It’s a perfect mix of action, emotion, and pure atmosphere.

You'll meet many unique characters but there were specifically 2 that stuck out to me which were Johnny and Panam. Johnny Silverhand, hes much more than just a side character, he’s the soul of this story. You’ll hate him, respect him, and eventually understand him. Panam Palmer brings a different level of emotion to the game every scene with her feels alive,  real, and full of heart. Her story is a roller-coaster of adrenaline, family, loyalty, and steamy romance (if you play male V). 

Then comes Phantom Liberty...it somehow it raises the bar even higher. The writing, the tension, the moral choices, it’s peak storytelling and really dives into the underworld of how twisted night city is. Even at the top of your game in this dlc you face many difficult choices regarding ""moral vs reason."" Every choice comes at a price as the story unfolds. From the start Reed and Songbird tone of the story perfectly. Both their roles in the story keeps you questioning loyalty, trust and survival. You’ll constantly wonder who’s telling the truth and what it means to do the right thing. 

I would 100% recommend this game, its truly amazing and worth a shot.",1664,286,0.0192307692307692,0.0240384615384615,0,0,0,4,0,0.1347560975609756,0.520383275261324,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,3,0,3,0,84.21666666666667,51.06666666666667,90.75,0,1,1,1,19.75855927171977,0.5627180899908173,0,90.75,3.0,1,1762053883,1762053883,0,1,0,0,4,0,1784,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

But after years of patches, updates, and a stellar expansion (Phantom Liberty), CD Projekt Red has finally delivered the game fans always dreamed of.
What started as a technical mess has evolved into one of the most immersive sci-fi RPGs ever made.

After years of patches, Cyberpunk 2077 finally lives up to its potential. It’s a dark, emotional, and deeply immersive RPG that rewards exploration, choice, and reflection. The world-building is unmatched, and with Phantom Liberty, it cements itself as one of the best sci-fi stories in gaming.",699,116,0.0329041487839771,0.0243204577968526,0,0,0,1,0,0.1044117647058823,0.5004901960784315,1,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,16,0,68.71666666666667,0.0,68.71666666666667,0,0,1,0,10.172204705311666,0.0,0,68.71666666666667,16.0,1,1762051973,1762051973,0,1,0,0,1,0,1784,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

208183701,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Really impossible to do anything but give it a big thumbs up. I avoided this game for years due to the disastrous launch. As of now, I can confidently say that whatever rough experience people had with Cyberpunk 2077 are not the experience that the game presents today. 

The stories, quests and characters are very well written. There are endearing, funny, introspective moments and everything inbetween, all tastefully written. The world building does an amazing job of presenting us a grim reality where morality is diluted as technology advances farther than what we as humans can rationalize.

The art direction is great, Night City looks great. Character's faces are what impressed me the most. Probably the best I've seen so far in a game. The lighting is also very well done: the way it reflects on objects in the world really surprises us, as players, with beautiful moments in the most unexpected ways.

In terms of gameplay, it's still pretty good, especially considering it's an open-world RPG of such huge size. However, this is where, for me, the downsides begin. The combat was alright (I played mostly a sword-wielding character, and had a lot of fun slicing and dicing, and they even let you block and reflect back enemie's bullets, which was awesome; parrying does a cool slow motion effect). However, I felt gunplay wasn't particular satisfying. What impressed me the least was the driving, which felt clunky and unresponsive at times.

Another criticism I have is the lack of NPC reactions to what you do. There are a lot of pedestrian NPCs just walking around, hanging about, which does help the world come alive at first glance. However, the way they just stand around a bit and don't really interact with you and each other, kind of makes the open world feel a bit hollow. Another thing that bothered me was how characters from quests, which have fleshed out personalities and dialogues, just stand there after they're done talking to you. Like after being sent off to do something, they'll then just stand there waiting for you to go, and there's no way to interact at all, ask them anything, etc. Especially with Johnny, who shows up a lot of times and will often just stand there staring at you. Having a line that you can say to him and repeat if necessary would, in my opinion, go a long way into making it so that NPCs don't feel like they're just there to deliver something to you.

In conclusion, I'll say again that Cyberpunk 2077 absolutely delivers a meaningful experience, which is an adjective that I don't usually attribute to games, or entertainment in general, and as such, absolutely worth it if you're looking for a more involved type of game.",2694,463,0.0174461766889383,0.0226429101707498,0,0,0,1,0,0.1836206896551724,0.5862068965517239,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1,0,42,381,48.8,18.066666666666663,48.8,0,0,0,0,55.204918032786885,0.3702185792349727,0,0.1280839895013123,0.1102362204724409,1,1762044823,1762044823,0,1,0,0,1,0,1784,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

The reason that I am leaving this a bad review is the optimization. I have a pretty beefy computer with no personal customizations, 32GB of ram, and a 4070 super. I have zero problems with any other game I own. CP2077 crashes on startup depending on what patch it is on. When I first bought it it crashed on startup. Eventually, after many months and a new patch, the game would startup and I could play.....though it would randomly crash once every two hours or so. I finally came back to it recently and it crashes on startup again. I spent hours troubleshooting and came to the realization that it's not my job to do this, that the creators have had ample time to fix this sort of thing and then choose not to. So I will attempt a refund and not be purchasing anymore CDPR games.",938,174,0.0266524520255863,0.0223880597014925,0,0,0,2,0,0.0267316017316017,0.5434704184704185,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,8,0,21.5,3.083333333333333,21.5,0,0,1,1,43.627906976744185,0.1434108527131783,0,21.5,8.0,1,1762036824,1762036896,1,1,0,0,1,0,1784,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

Cyberpunk 2077 is incredibly replayable. With its immense, vibrant Night City, you’ll find yourself completely absorbed — it’s hard to leave the city that never sleeps.

Recommended for anyone who enjoys story-driven games.

Things I loved:
- The immersive world and liveliness of Night City
- Outstanding voice acting
- Engaging gameplay mechanics (reminded me a bit of Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst crossed with a FPS)

Things I didn’t like:
- Too many repetitive NCPD scanner missions
- Not being able to romance Judy Alvarez as Male V 😅",596,99,0.0587248322147651,0.0134228187919463,0,0,0,1,2,0.2905555555555555,0.5905555555555555,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,2,39,93.08333333333331,25.25,93.08333333333331,0,1,0,0,6.402864816472695,0.2712623097582811,0,2.3867521367521367,0.0512820512820512,1,1762032854,1762032854,0,1,0,0,2,0,1784,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

208158922,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,I regret playing this game. Why ? Because I don't have a cyber brain to wipe so I can experience it all again. Listen even with all the updates this game is still rife with bugs and just weird gremlins messing with how the NPCs and vehicles spawn and work. Despite all that I still enjoyed myself. I enjoyed what I was shown. However the game does feel empty and shallow at times. That might just be because I've run my character around the world more than once. I hope I'm still alive if and when they drop Cyberpunk Part 2 or some other DLC after Phantom Liberty.,565,108,0.0442477876106194,0.015929203539823,0,1,0,1,0,-0.0598484848484848,0.5340909090909091,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,34,0,288.81666666666666,0.0,288.81666666666666,0,0,1,0,1.9562582953430665,0.0,0,288.81666666666666,34.0,1,1762024041,1762024167,1,1,0,0,2,0,1784,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,333572,45538,8,Very Positive,333572,45538

Although, the devs have finally delivered a great product 5 years later, and it is an absolutely amazing game to play. This game is one of my favorites, and stays close to my heart. The anime added a lot to Cyberpunk, and it's also worth a watch. Amazing sound track as well, and obviously the graphics are amazing.

Did not like it overall. Still has anoying bugs. Will never buy a game from that company again. The decisions the player have to take don't make sense sometime. To be more specific the outcome of the decisions are not clear before you make them. 

Had to search on the internet sometimes because I was stuck and found out that everytime it was a bug or really bad level deisgn. Doesn't live up to the hype. 

Also these super long conversations killed it for me. I thought I play an action game, but 80% conversations and 20% action isn't a good ratio. It was more anoying than anything.

Edit: okay I searched on the internet know and found out that very early decisions in conversations prevent you days later to do what you want. E.g. the very early answers you give to one very specific Jonny conversation will determine some stuff at the very end of the game.

Regardless of its buggy launch, I think the game is in a great state now. I enjoy the gameplay a lot, it feels like a nice mix of RPG and Immersive Sim, which is a genre I love. I love the characters and the story. Some of the writing has had a big impact on me.

It's the world that always brings me back, though. Night City is truly just something else, the scale and density and layers of it, it [i]feels[/i] like the cyberpunk dystopian city that it is. It's easy to get lost in it just walking around, and there's a feeling when you watch an NPC leave or you go around a corner like they've just disappeared into this vast jungle of neon and metal. It's intimidating in the best way, and the city just won't leave my brain. Whether it's the staggring skyscrapers and waterfalls of neon adorning them, or the quiet badlands and their open sky interrupted with babel-esque towers of advertising, well, I'll let Jackie say it.

208090070,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Wow. Bought on sale solely to scratch an itch for dystopian punk vibes, ended up sitting in silence staring at a black screen as electric cello ripped my heart into little bits. Games are usually fun, sometimes impactful; this story hits you like a gut punch and doesn't let you forget it. The gameplay is fresh and dynamic and leaves so many options for how you choose to approach it. The world isn't just immersive, there are times it feels like a real place somewhere. Don't even get me started on the voice acting. No matter what life path and choices you go with, you cant escape the emotional weight of Cyberpunk 2077. I got so lost in the story that V wasn't my character, they were ME and I was V. Your choices actually matter, and you feel every single one. The world is so massive and detailed, endless possibilities for exploration and storylines you never even notice on your first playthrough. This review would be an essay if I didn't cut myself short, so here's my best summary:

- Leaves you with real, deep emotions (and crippling depression) and thoughts that you simply don't forget
- Thrusts you into a deep, detailed, immersive world that swallows you whole and never really lets you go
- Voice acting gives you chills, and the soundtrack makes you feel things no video game should be able to
- Engaging, intuitive, and enjoyable gameplay mechanics and so much variety and diversity in approaches

Won't just replay this again, I will remember every single new story I write through V's eyes in the absurd and beautiful Night City.

208065098,1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,bombing,recent_all,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the video game industry. Since its release, it has been acclaimed for its deep and complex narrative that transports players to a dystopian future where technology and humanity intertwine in fascinating and often unsettling ways. Night City, the main setting, is a character in itself: vibrant, dangerous, and full of life and secrets. Its urban design, blending futuristic architecture with echoes of the past, creates a unique and captivating atmosphere. The attention to detail in every corner of the city from the glowing neon lights to the dark alleys invites exploration and discovery. The environments are so rich and diverse that each district has its own identity, from the luxurious skyscrapers of the corporate zone to the slums where survival is a daily struggle.The freedom of choice that Cyberpunk 2077 offers is another one of its greatest strengths. Players can shape their experience through their decisions, affecting not only the main narrative but also the world around them. This ability to influence the story creates a sense of agency rarely found in other games, allowing for multiple playthroughs without ever feeling repetitive. The consequences of your actions are tangible and often unexpected, adding another layer of depth to the experience. For example, choosing to help a side character might open new opportunities or close others making every decision truly matter.
The characters in Cyberpunk 2077 are memorable and deeply developed. From the protagonist, V, to Johnny Silverhand, masterfully portrayed by Keanu Reeves, every character has clear motivations and a well defined narrative arc. The supporting cast is also meticulously crafted, each with their own story that contributes to the rich tapestry of the game’s world. The chemistry between characters and the dynamics of their relationships add an emotional depth that enriches the narrative. Keanu Reeves, in particular, brings a charismatic presence that elevates the entire experience.The visual design of the game is simply stunning. The art direction is an achievement in itself, creating a city that feels both futuristic and nostalgic. The lighting effects, color palette, and futuristic architecture come together to create a visual experience that is both beautiful and oppressive. Every corner of Night City feels alive filled with energy and activity constantly inviting players to explore and uncover its secrets. The attention to detail in the visual effects, such as raindrops sliding down windows or neon lights reflecting on puddles, is breathtaking. It’s as if every pixel was carefully placed to create a truly immersive experience.
Character customization is another one of Cyberpunk 2077’s greatest strengths. Players have a wide range of options to create their ideal version of V, from appearance to abilities. This customization extends to gameplay style, allowing players to tailor their approach based on their preferences whether it’s hacking, melee combat, or gunfights. The freedom of choice in customization not only adds depth to the game but also lets players experiment with different playstyles and discover new strategies. You can be a lethal mercenary, a master hacker, or a balanced mix of both, and each path offers a unique experience.The soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own. Featuring a selection of music that ranges from electronic to rock, every track is carefully chosen to complement the game’s atmosphere. The voice acting and performances especially from well-known actors are top notch, enhancing the narrative and immersing players even deeper into the world of Cyberpunk. The soundtrack doesn’t just accompany the action; it reflects the mood and emotions of the characters, adding another layer of immersion. I remember one particular mission where the pulsating electronic music kept me on the edge of my seat during an intense chase.
The side missions in Cyberpunk 2077 are another major highlight. Each one is carefully crafted, offering rich storytelling and memorable characters. These missions don’t just add hours of gameplay they deepen the world of Cyberpunk, revealing more of its stories and secrets. The variety of side quests ensures there’s something for everyone, from hacking jobs to combat missions to exploration-based tasks. Each side mission is so well-built that it often feels like a short film within the game. One of my favorites was the mission where I had to infiltrate a corporation to steal sensitive data the tension and strategy involved made every moment thrilling.The open world of Night City is visually stunning, bursting with atmosphere and detail. The freedom to explore allows players to lose themselves in its streets and uncover hidden secrets. The city feels alive, populated with characters ranging from the humble to the powerful, each with their own story to tell. The interaction with NPCs is rich and varied, allowing for deep and often surprising conversations. I remember once meeting an old man in an alley who shared a touching story about his life in Night City moments like that make the game’s world feel truly alive and real.
The gameplay offers a wide range of options, from hacking to melee combat and gunfights. Character customization is extensive, allowing players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences. The freedom of choice in side missions and the ability to shape the story based on your decisions are key strengths that make every player’s experience unique. The depth of customization and freedom of choice ensures that each playthrough feels distinct. You can decide how to approach every situation, and each decision carries consequences that impact your progress throughout the game. In summary, Cyberpunk 2077 is a monumental achievement in the world of video games. With its rich narrative, memorable characters, stunning visual design, and freedom of choice, it delivers a truly unique and profound experience. It’s a game that fans of science fiction and open world RPGs should not miss.

PROS: The story is amazing, the city feels more alive than any other game I've played, the amount of build variety is great, voice acting is top notch, graphics are top tier, the DLC is up there with ""Blood and Wine"" in Witcher 3, and I don't think I've had a single crash or game breaking bug since 2.0 released.

CONS: Brain Dance Tutorial when you do a fresh start.

I've played this on PS4, PS5, and now I can say I've played it on Steam. Am I obsessed? Mad? Have more money than sense? Perhaps. But just like those old ads about how Snickers satisfies, this game well and truly satisfies.

Cherami Leigh voices the female version of the main character, and Keanu Reeves voices the antagonist. I say antagonist, not villain. That is someone else. But between these two, I feel like Cyberpunk is brought to life like no other game has for me in the past. Apparently Keanu liked the role so much he asked for more. Cherami's voice seems so full of emotion and desperation that I have to pinch myself, tell myself it isn't real. Because it seems so real...

Hand-in-hand with great voice acting is the eye-candy visuals of a 2077 gone mad. The game is chock full of detail! Neon lights, people with body modifications (cyberware), weather effects, streets full of garbage and vending machines, winding confusing roads snaking back on themselves, over and under, merging and separating. Various gangs, corporations, individuals. It's almost a child-like wonder just to look around, marvel at the experience.

Part of the charm of this game is the interactions between V and your antagonist, Johnny Silverhand (Keanu). Through a bizarre set of circumstances you are stuck on a journey through life together, a journey through death. So many magical epiphanies, realisations, sacrifices. The endings hit HARD, but the main game endings are where it is at. While Phantom Liberty has some great endings as well, I don't like the additional 'V' ending.

There's a lot to do in the game. With enough content to rival most RPGs of yesteryear, you'll easily rack up 200 hours or more just to get through everything (a little less for me this time due to 3rd playthrough). There are cars to steal (if you have the dlc), lots of side gigs, various main missions and multiple endings. There are cyberpsychos to subdue, lots of skills to max out, various character builds to explore, and various tactics to take advantage of. Weapons can be upgraded, weapon mods can be upgraded - even your cyberware can be upgraded and enhanced with modifiers, which you get some limited control over if you build your character right.

Play styles vary from pistols, to machine guns, snipers, shotguns, revolvers, or even blunt weapons, or swords... you can even forego combat altogether and try to get through the game using just your cyberdeck, and stealth takedowns. 

Additional features (this is by no means all of them) include slow motion buffs, monowires, gorilla claws, or even overclocking your cyberware, and even smart weapons that can fire homing shots. 

There are so many options of how to play the game that there is sure to be something for everyone. And with no achievements being difficulty-specific, it doesn't matter what you use. Everything is effective.


But are there any negatives? Any hitches or problems?

I've found extended play sessions can cause the game to hang and close, so perhaps there's a memory leak. Occasionally there would be loot issues, for example weapons stuck under destroyed vehicles, I once had a policeman standing half in the pavement but this had no effect on anything. Also I feel I should caution against driving super fast - depends on your settings and rig of course, but you might put unnecessary strain on your system as the game struggles to keep loading textures and objects. Best thing to do is only max your settings for photo mode.

Sadly there isn't much in the way of 3rd-person cutscenes, so no matter how pretty or cool you make your protagonist, you won't see him or her much. Some endings will let you see your V talk, show emotions. Motorbikes are a good idea if you want to see your toon. Also, photo mode is kind of restrictive - most story moments would not let the camera free from 1st person view, so that is a bit of a let down.


As an overall experience, and taking into account replayability, Cyberpunk 2077 is an overwhelming success. Even the few problems you might encounter are miniscule when weighed against the sheer enjoyment the game has to offer.

Final warning though, if you don't like swearing then this game might not be for you :(

If I can give a surface level description of this game, think of ""Layers of Fear"" and the pros and cons of that game; but with a more compelling and tragic story.  In the very least it has an actual ending. And the build up to that ending was... *sniffles*... lets just say after playing the game I had to get up from my computer to walk around, contemplating life and it's frailties. 

I enjoyed ""Layers of Fear"" so I can look past some of the cons in that one, like it being a 'walking sim.' However the only downside, for me personally, is that in the game you walk pretty slowly (there isn't a quicker pace/jog button). 

It is also important to note that this game is 2 to 3 hours long, which is fine. The game was as long as it needed to be to tell its story.

So, this is going to be a rather long and tedious explanation on the political crapstorm for you folks who don't know Chinese. I'll try to be as neutral as possible. 
Players found a seal of the in-game cult which has 'winnie the pooh' and 'Xi Jingping' on it. Later some PRC ‘patriot’ alerted the public and government body on social media. Most Taiwanese think the mainlander were triggered because they are brainwashed to support their leader, however this is not quite the case. While some so called 'patriots' indeed got triggered by that, the majority are not too bothered by that. Most mainlanders are triggered because after this discovery, a lot of the seemingly non-political things in this game start to make sense in a political way.  They start to see proofs that this game hides suggestive insults to the general public in the mainland. 
This game is about a cult, the cult leader's name has the exact same pronunciation as  'Mainland citizen'. If you know Chinese you know there are four or more tones for the same syllable, even the tones are the same in this case. Then the cult itself is named 'lu xin she', 'da lu' ('the mainland') is the general term for the mainland. 'xin' is 'heart' or 'mind' in Chinese. 'she' is a society. So basically people interpret this cult is as a metaphor of those who supports the mainland. The victim in this game is named 'Mei Xin'. 'Mei' generally means beauty, but it is also the name of America ('Mei Guo', emit the 'guo' for country.) So people interpreted this as 'the heart for America'. So this all starts to make sense to the mainland audience as a narrative of 'Mainland citizens' and the 'people who supports mainland' prosecute the 'desire/heart/support for America'. Which the mainland audience felt is clearly a separatism agenda. The cult sacrificial day is set on October 1st to 7th (This October is not the lunar October, lunar October 1st would make sense in this case because traditionally lunar October 1st is a day to make offering to the dead), just happens to be the PRC National Foundation day and its public holiday.  The cult candles also adds up to 49, 1949 October 1st is the foundation day of PRC. Now I personally don't know if the team really was targeting the mainland audience or not. I personally doubt it is, because this is wayyy too obvious. This would be like a 12 years old thinks god emperor Trump meme is top notch political commentary. On the other hand red candle had shown particular attention to the use of date and details before, you can read more about the various dates in detention. Very few Taiwanese seems to mention this, the ones who mentioned it dismissed it as baseless speculations, but that's probably the major reason that many former mainland fans lost faith in the developer as they see it as a direct insult to the common people, not just the government. Many mainland gamers also worry that such a politically sensitive game could trigger a knee jerk reaction from the Chinese government to completely ban steam all together.
This whole situation sparked a full-on online war between mainlanders and Taiwanese. The investors and publisher have all backed off and cut ties, the studio is under quite a crisis now. Their mainland social media account is deleted, the game is pull off from Chinese steam. PRC gamers started a massive review bombing campaign on the game. Some made fake screenshot and other materials to 'prove' the studio's supposed sinister intent. While some bought the game only to leave a negative review before they ask for refund. The rating dropped from overwhelmingly positive to mixed in a matter of hours. Many influencer and streamer who previously gave condolences to the game now has either cut ties or actively express their discontent. The studio has come out with various apologise and declaration statements to no avail, only to fuel the conflict even further. According to the team, the cult seal is a mistake left accidentally in by one of the graphic designers, who used popular online slangs as testing material. The mainland gamers don't believe this at all and insist the studio itself is responsible for their hidden political agenda. They also believe the studio only apologised because they are still interested in the mainland market, which only angered the gamers more. On the Taiwanese side it triggered a wave of negative attitude towards mainland gamers. There are already quite a lot of anti-mainland and dependence sentiments, especially after Xi mentioned that the PRC government will still consider military unification an option in this lunar new year's open letter to public. The reactions from mainland gamers only dragged their already negative view of mainland public into an abysmal level.  They can't understand the overreaction and they think to keep pushing and prosecute the studio after the apology is very unreasonable. Many despise what they regard as overly politically sensitive, and self-censoring mainlanders. From their perspective, it's very hypocritical of the mainlanders to promote the game as a 'homemade game' at the start then quickly turn 180 and condemn it once this shitstorm blows out. There are also cracked pirate version of the game already circulating in mainland websites despite the price is half of its international price in PRC.
OK that's pretty much it. I hope this long and boring explanation shed a bit light for you confused bystanders. I personally think the game is decent. I don't see any suggestive theme outside of the supposed metaphoric names.  This is NOT a review for the game however, this is my mere attempt to help people to understand the situation. Some details may be completely wrong, but this is my understanding of the situation.

Although the first person view does bring motion sickness to a whole new level. Compounded with the self-mutilating scene, it could be quite uncomfortable. All in all a great buy.

Devotion has you play as a man looking for his daughter, while trying to piece together your own past on the events leading up to her daughter's disappearance.

“如果批评不自由，则赞美无意义”。2013年之前，吐槽或者玩政治梗只是相视一笑，如果实在很讨厌也会生气，但不至于到现在这种狂欢式的网络暴力的程度。
维尼不代表大陆，至少他不能代表我。而我很喜欢这个彩蛋，结合被爆出来之后的各种反应，我觉得把他画在符上一点也没错，甚至是一种可以称为行为艺术的精妙的讽刺。
我很爱大陆，很爱中国。歌哭于斯、聚国族于斯。我希望中国能变得更自信和开放。可现在处处噤声。
如果中国的同胞们看到我这条评论，希望你们能去关注王林清，去关注赵宇。希望你们知道佳士、耒阳、寿光、厦门，记得三原色和疫苗。比起一个贴图，有太多的东西值得我们去在乎了。那才是和我们生活息息相关的。
我心目中中国的未来，是政治家为人民服务，而不是人民的神。政治讽刺是达到这样的未来的必备的东西。

49223071,1006510,Devotion,bombing,recent_all,"I really enjoyed Red Candle's previous game, Detention so I was hyped about this game. Man did they deliver! It's a massive graphic upgrade from Detention yet the same unique horror vibe carried over. Sure the jump scares are sometimes cheesy but there's more to the game that chills you to the bone. Of course what makes this game special is the Chinese culture aspect, which is rarely represented in horror games, or video games in general.

OK now on to the elephant in the room: the ""politically motivated"" image. Sure it doesn't add anything to the game but I don't think it deserves the negativity and uhm, rage. As a mainland-born Chinese, I find it funny and sad that some of my fellow people can't take something directed at a political figure (whether Xi is evil is not even relevant). I thought I had read enough dystopian fiction on how oppressive regimes can transform the people but this is even beyond the imagination of literature. I understand the part where they fear this may get the game, or even the entirety of Steam, banned given the current atmosphere against video games in China. For that reason I think Red Candle Games made a poor choice: not that they are not entitled to expressing themselves but as I said they included something that didn't add anything to the game theme. However, I do want to say to the players who share that fear: you should realize it is the government bodies that impose censorship, not the artist themselves. Playing ""safe"" may buy you a sense of safety, but not really.

Growing up watching Taiwanese TV show with my grandmother. Some of those have horror elements. Playing this game is like going back in time to my childhood's memories.

The apartment and the atmosphere are exactly what I have in mind. Dark room with red ambient light. I hate that....

Story is interesting. It kept me want for more after read through those scripts and want to find out what has happened in the game.

But game companies should not include political content (content insulting) that has nothing to do with the game content in the game. No one would like to be told that food is mixed with feces after tasting good food. And the restaurant refuses to refund, ridicules the guest and prohibits the guest from giving an evaluation. This disgusting experience comes from RedCandleGames.

如果你不是中國人，你不懂中文，那麼我會推薦你游玩這款遊戲。因為“邪教”是世界範圍內所有人都需要警惕的，不單指中國人。而且從畫面、音樂、故事情節體現都有很高的製作水準，雖然流程很短，但無可厚非這是一款優秀的遊戲。

但遊戲公司不應該在遊戲裡加入與遊戲內容毫無關係的政治內容（侮辱性）。沒有人會喜歡在品嚐美好的食物之後，被告知食物裡摻了屎。餐廳不僅拒絕退款，還嘲笑客人並禁止客人發出不滿的評價。以上的惡劣體驗均來自赤燭一手優秀的操作。

-Long corridors
-slow walking speed
-Long corridors that make you walk even slower
All this to make the game longer, so people can't get a refund, I feel like I did not get my money's worth on this game, and I recommend you buy this game on sale. 
Now, on to the horror aspect. This game does have some moments that are quite nerve wracking, but it felt like they're few and far between, and any moments that are meant to be scary I was often met with a jumpscare- which only about two of them successfully made me jump. But all others I *knew* was going to happen and made the game less scary for me, I am of the belief that a psychological horror should not rely on jumpscares to scare the player, as I felt this game did. BUT despite the reliance on jumpscares I will say the moments that did have tension- were very well done. 
TLDR: Artificially lengthened, Story is great, couple jumpscares- could be done better imo, BUY ON SALE!!!

Unlike Detention the ending is pretty obvious from the word ""go"" just from well worn horror tropes, but that's not really what we are here for. We're unpacking why those events happened, and the world that caused those issues. The design can be a bit confusing at times, especially one point where you get a variety of places to go and each one can change arbitrarily, but overall it's pretty good at subtly telegraphing where you are supposed to go. I do think that the switch to first person is to the benefit of the game, a third person Detention-esque style would not have allowed you to see the small details that makes the apartments feel more lived-in and alive.

There is a lot of untranslated Mandarin in the game but it's all secondary stuff, I played with my mandarin-speaking wife and we didn't find anything that would cause an issue for english-only speakers.

Sure it's a horror game it provides several moments which freaked me out during the game. However, what I appreciate most is the great story about the tragedy of a family with a father who has superstition of certain dark religion. The protagonist has to pay for redemption for the tragedy he caused in this game. I could feel the burden he bore throughout the game play. Instead of most of the horror games which emphasize on scaring the shit out of players, this game actually gives us a reflection about ""family"" - no matter what kind of methods you family have used, they always have good intention behind, though the methods are sometimes not intellegent.

I would give this game 10/10, considering it's an indie game. And please ignore the angry Chinese users on Steam they simply can't listen to any negative comments to their dictated leader in their filthy country. They've spammed the negative reviews that's why at this moment the overall review in the game store is shown as ""mixed"" despite it was once ""overwhelmingly positive"" at first.

The music, especially the ending credit and theme songs, fits the atmosphere so well that I couldn't stop looping it in my head.
It was not as scary as I thought (i.e. not many jumpscares or gore), but it's definitely creepy af. It's that type of games that keeps you awake at night.
For those who are worrying about the short gameplay: don't rush it through, take your time to absorb the Taiwanese culture in the 80's and learn the backstory. It's gonna be much scarier when you could immerse yourself in that place in time where people were blinded by their own superstition (well, ironically that's exactly what happened to this game recently).

What you get in the package is your typical spooky walking simulator, albeit with an interesting flavor that Asian culture gives it.

Maybe I didn't read all in-game notes crucial to the story, but you don't get an actual closure to the story. Only symbolism, which there are lots of in Devotion. I also kinda liked that 2D platformer section, which could be a game of its own. Also, the artstyle of the ending sequence. It's really gorgeous.

In my opinion, however, the game would have been way better if the developers went with psychological horror genre and didn't include jumpscares. These were really annoying.

Even though I am not a person who likes horror game, especially the one including jump scares, the sound effect and art design in Devotion are wonderful. Red candle perfectly reappears Taiwanese society in 1980s. 

Unfortunately, this game is receiving an uncountable negative review left by Chinese player. The reason was an in-game charm said, “Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh Moron”. Since Red Candle received the report by the player on Feb 21, they fixed the charm immediately (v1.0.5). However, the most of Chinese player has downloaded the ""pirated"" Devotion. Therefore, the charm mistake couldn't be fixed since it can't update by Steam. The charm incidence makes the majority of Chinese player keep abusing this wonderful game and say it hides an ideology of ""pro-Taiwan independence"". Moreover, another game produced by Red Candle in 2017, Detention, is receiving critical common as well.

On the released date of Devotion, the streamers all around the world has opened the live stream, including Chinese players. Since most of the Chinese people think Taiwan is a part of China, they added ""Domestic game"" on the title of their stream. However, after the charm incidence, Devotion, any related video and discussion were banned in China with the following criticisms to Red Candle. In order to express their anger, Chinese players malicious left negative reviews to pull down the rating. In my opinion, it is irrational and ridiculous. I still see people discussing Devotion on social media, opening stream on Youtube and reading the article about the meaning behind the game. Therefore, it is an evidence to prove that Taiwan is an independent country with the freedom and democracy.

Last time, Red Candle told us the White Horror happened in 1950s, taught us to cherish the freedom and democratic society we have today. This time, they are going to bring you to 80s. Through the investigation in the old apartment, you gonna discover how the pure paternal love and the superstition lead the story to a tragic ending.

As a Taiwanese, I hope the players from other country can give a try to this amazing game which made by Taiwanese team.

Thank you Red Candle, looking forward to your next product :)

Try to censor something unfavorable, only to amplify its message.

I didn't plan to buy this game in the first place as I am a scaredy cat to horror games, but after I read about all the Winnie the Pooh drama, I fully support game developers' freedom of speech to criticize matters as they see fit; a right that sadly does not exist in China.

So I basically bought this game to own the commies. Bite me.

Even my game experience mostly consists of ""NOPE NOPE NOPE JUMPSCARE COMING NOPE"", the plot element is extremely powerful. Piece by piece you discover the story behind the family and how misplaced love and care can lead to tragedy, despite the genuine empathy.

The sound effect is also the best, give it the background sound of typhoon nights, the bird tweeting door bell sound, water bowling pot, and again, all of these are just like coming out of real life memory. The music is also the best, such as Lady of the pier, it's a lovely song that I cannot stop listen to it again and again. And talking about the story, it's yet another best thing I've ever seen. Personally I went through many of the struggles and the emotional up and down people had in the game plot, I can totally feel the way the character felt in the game.

49203662,1006510,Devotion,bombing,recent_all,"[b]Devotion[/b] is a true [b]masterpiece[/b], whether on its story, graphics, atmosphere, music or the details on religious and background of TW. I have played games with good contents, graphics or good atmospheres. Please ignore the bombarding negative reviews of Devotion which might distort your impression of this game. [i]Many of the reviews are [b]irrational, unreasonable and heavily biased[/b] due to some contents included in the game.[/i] Despite some controversial “[url=https://www.spieltimes.com/original/xi-jinping-winnie-the-pooh-in-devotion-the-taiwanese-perspective-the-chinese-perspective-the-neutral-ground/]political issues [/url]” being raised, it is still a great masterpiece. [spoiler][strike]With these issues, it is even a greater masterpiece that ironically symbolizes the reality..[/strike][/spoiler]
[h1]Overview[/h1]
[b]Devotion is labeled as a horrific game, but it is actually a quality storytelling and interactive movie-game.[/b] If you are looking for a super scary game like outlast, this might not fit with your desire. Still, the team did a great job treating scary moments (you do need to have braveness and a strong heart). Although everything looks familiar to me, the cultural influence still makes me feel creepy. The story is based on Taiwanese society around 80s, depicting a family that was influenced by the social atmosphere and false religious beliefs. The story is well designed, suspenseful, tragic, but cozy and touching. I really enjoyed it. The open ending makes me feel complex and makes me be involved in figuring out what is really going on with the story.
[h1]In-Game Contents[/h1]
[b]The game has crazy amount of details and references, especially on the religious aspect.[/b] The graphics might not be as good as 3A title games, but it’s still very realistic like you’re in one of the old apartments. It’s pretty detailed that’s enough to create the environment and horrific atmosphere for storytelling, especially at this price point. The texture and the objects are realistic. The apartment looks very similar to the old houses that you will see in Taiwan. There are lots of references based on the contemporary background, such as the posters, TV show, time and dates, etc. The religious references are very detail as well, such as the rituals, idols, taboo. [b]The music is very good. It is [i]amazing beautiful[/i][/b], illustrated by the team and the award winning Mandarin Band to display the girl Mei Shin’s complex mind. 
[h1]Issues[/h1]
However, there are indeed somethings that makes me a little bit disappointed but will not affect the actual gaming experience. I would agree that there are some points where the climax has not been reached but already ends. In other words, I wish there would be more things. In regard to the amulet that most Chinese people felt insulting, it will not affect the gameplay if you don't figure out very carefully. [i]Those angry people are taking the game too seriously and led boycotting[/i]. The controversial amulet, although does sound like insulting the leader of China, [u][b]does not have direct meaning and you can have other interpretations.[/b][/u] Nonetheless, though claimed as mistakes, the game developers need to take some responsibilities (they did) for that because it does sound a bit like [u]personal insulting[/u] ([b]repeat: not humiliating[/b]). [b]Nonetheless, the dates and the numbers in the game, like stated at the beginning, are just truly coincident and fictional. For example, the date [b]Oct 7th 1987[/b] is actually moon-festival (families would gather) and has lunar eclipse, which is a really bad sign. The seventh day after death 10/7 is the first day the spirit will come back and revisit. The number ""88"" in Mandarin sound and mean exactly as ""bye bye"".[/b]

[h1]In-Depth Explainations[/h1]
*Spoiler Alert* Some explanations after gameplay if you do not understand (put pointer on black box):
[spoiler]
[olist]
[*]The game Devotion in Chinese is called “還願(huan2yuan4)”, and it is a pun. Ex.The last sentence of the song at the ending says “你還願(hai2yuan4)意嗎?” or [b]""Child’s Willingness"" ""孩願”[/b].
[*]There is a lot of cycling in the story, such as the ending loop, going to different doors with the same rooms, etc. Spirits might experience this if that he/she suicide or did something bad before death. This can continue for many many times until your sin is being cleansed. Most players believe you are experiencing the father’s cycling.
[*]1st Jumpscare: There's a saying that you should never look/turn back, or else you will lose ""three flames of your soul"" and your body will be controlled by the ghost/evil spirit.
[*]There's a scene where you repeatedly walk on the same aisle for many times, it is called ""Ghost hitting the wall""; happens when the ghost is interfering your mind. 
[*]In Buddhism or Daoism, there are good idols and bad ones (or bad idols, possibly spirits pretending to be fake god). In this case, Cigu Guanyin is considered as a bad idol (*Cigu Guanyin is a fake idol made up by the dev. team, however, it is referred to the real god called ""Zi Gu"". The storybook basically tells a bit of ZiGu). You can recognize it by its sitting pose, the instruments that the idol is using, their finger pose, etc. Usually, when you pray and your wish comes true, you will need to redeem a vow to god, which is “devotion”. If you did not devote, then bad things will happen as a consequence. Cigu Guanyin probably wants Du to sacrifice. The mentor is a kind of prophet and probably uses Cigu Guanyin power to cheat on others. 
[*]The spiritual world operated through Guan Ling Rite called ""觀落陰GuanLuoYin"", a special way to communicate with the spirits (*not to sacrifice*). However, I have only heard of it. People would say you can communicate with you dead relatives using this method.
[*]Possible reasons that her daughter is sick: pressure from her parents or the apartment they lived in. The apartment, according to the poster leaks from the game dev, is a haunted house. There's a saying in Taiwan that if you live in a haunted house, you will lose your luck, becomes unhealthy, and other bad things might occur.

還原台灣1980時代的場景，美術做的非常真實，故事很感傷的真實案件改編

I give praise
This game is great
Restoring the scenes of the 1980s in Taiwan, the art is very real, and the story is very sentimental.
I believe that every region will have the same evil religious fraud incident.
This game is also alert to everyone not to be deceived again.
The story is not over yet, I hope to play the new DLC as soon as possible.

The Chinese region, because of Winnie the Pooh, caused political associations and refused to play the game and refunded fees. Master Yoda of Taiwan felt sad.

49200151,1006510,Devotion,bombing,recent_all,"Games are a form of escapism. Maybe, after a long hard day of work, you want to vent your anger. You can go and play a shooter or a slasher. It is relaxing. Maybe, you just want to chill and forget your troubles with some simulator or walk in a beautiful surreal scenery as a form of meditation. Maybe you want to feel something that you could never feel in real life in a safety of your appartment with racing games. Want to feel like a hero? RPG. Want to feel like smart general? Strategy. Want to stop feeling lonely? Dating sims. Want intellectual exercise? Puzzles. Want some adrenaline? Horror games.
Games are supposed to be fun. Not ""funny"", they don't have to be lighthearted. But fun. Something that will make you immerse yourself in world, different from your own and feel satisfied when you're done. And not feel like you're being forced into the real world against your will once more.

I know two languages - English and Russian. I can't read the political message the ingame posters carry. And so, I just played this game, not knowing about the shitstorm surrounding it. And I liked this game.
Detention was, hands down, my favorite horror from 2017, so I expected more of the same from Devotion. Some horror, but not as a main focus. Good, interesting, intriguing story, with a lot of symbolism. And in that regard, Devotion was a bit of a letdown. I still enjoyed it, but it was not as good as Detention.

The symbolism was a very prominent part of Detention. I still think that the way they presented [spoiler]the reading list[/spoiler] in that game was top-tier brilliance, one of the best moves in games that I've seen. Right from the start, Devotion presents you with [spoiler]""I"" in it's title drawn as a cigarette, some characters that form lungs, your ""protagonist"" is a heavy smoker and your child has problems with breathing. You would think that that would play some role in the game, right? Wrong. They literally never came back to the theme of smoking.[/spoiler] That was a completely pointless misdirection. And all the other symbolism in the game was way too on the nose and easy to read. It was just... uninspired. I knew where the story was going after less than an hour of gameplay, and until the end, there were zero surprises.
Not to mention that the ending itself was awful. Abrupt, it didn't draw that final line I was hoping to see, instead just showing you some surreal visage and credits. It was awfully unsatisfying.
Other than that though, the game was alright. I liked the story, predictable as it was. The voice acting was great. The music was fantastic. The horror elements... kinda disappeard after the 1/3 of the game, with the rest of it being hardly scary at all. It's just an average game, that I enjoyed playing and will forget much faster than I could ever forget Detention.

However.

No matter what the message, you shouldn't use games as your political platform. As a Russian, I'm sick and tired of listening about ""those evil Russians"" in American media. And I'm equally tired of listening about how ""we are so virtuous, unlike those horrible spoiled Americans"" in Russian. I don't need to hear about Ukraine, I don't need to hear about England, about feminism, transgenders, homophobia, racism from either side - they are both equally annoying - I don't need this in my ""free from this political bullshit"" time. Time I use to escape and have fun. Time, I play videogames.
And while I personally have no attachment to the conflict this particular drama is about, I don't think that Devotion devs had the right to take that time of peace away from their players. It is dirty. It is despicable. It is... just a shame that what could just be a cute little story, a fun horror game, had to turn into... this.

Great game for a small studio, the visuals and nods to Taiwanese culture is amazing, the story is simple, gameplay is smooth.
Ignore the buttthurt Chinese trolls that are downvoting this game.

What I love about this game is how they managed ambition with practicality, the game doesn't try to outdo others like Layers of Fear, instead focusing on what they can do, they managed to create a short, simple story that isn't overly-ambitious to a point of exhaustion, which makes it on par for most of the genre-defining horror walking simulators. But it's more than that, for me it threads the line between Gone Home and Layers of Fear, while definitely a horror game, it doesn't bind itself to the genre, instead choosing to start from horror, but as you unravel the story, the monsters become human, morphing from horror to a family tragedy. Horror about what happened slowly turns into a father's search for truth.



[list]Pros:
[*] Good aptmosphere
[*] Few pure jumpscares, and when they do exist, they are used as a climax point after building up the sense of dread.
[*] Creative scares
[*] Delves deeply into Taiwanese culture.
[/list]
[list]Cons:
[*] The minigame was a bit off, but seemed like a nod to the earlier game by the same company
[*]Ending a bit too hipstery for me.
[/list]
[list]Favorite parts:
[*] The red umbrella is such a haunting image.
[*] [spoiler]Pulling out my own tongue made me squirm so much[/spoiler]
[*] [spoiler]The entire hallway chase scene and the end of it where the wife's ghost turns human was so horrifying/breathtaking [/spoiler]

49194699,1006510,Devotion,bombing,recent_all,"With Devotion Red Candle cements itself as one the best indie horror devs right now; able to build atmosphere without throwing screaming JPEGs at your face and able to intertwine it with well-written human stories.

Like Red Candle’s first game, Detention, Devotion is an adventure game but this time it’s a first person adventure game instead of being point and click. Puzzles tend to be logical and non-complex as well as doing a good job tying into what’s going on. There’s even a few gameplay shakeups too, like a third person puzzle platformer segment. There is one segment where you to have run away from a monster but it’s not that that bad, as long as you keep running you’re fine. Overall the gameplay is some solid adventure gaming.

The game’s atmosphere is fantastic, setting itself in a dream-like rundown apartment building. Most of the game’s horror is more subdued, i.e. noises in the dark, rooms shifting around as you leave them. There are a few jump scare moments, but there are rare and for the most part are earned. It also does cool aesthetic stuff like one segment where you control something akin to a museum diorama and another segment inside a storybook. There is even some FMV when it comes to stuff on the TV and apparently Red Candle got a live band and everything for the singing contest segments which is cool. The soundtrack is great too.

Just like Detention, Devotion has a strong narrative too.  Like Detention it’s also set in Taiwan, during the 80’s this time though. Unlike Detention, the historical context of Devotion isn’t as strong a focus though, instead delving more into the personal lives of its characters. Said characters being a  small family and their struggles, one major focus being how the father and his refusal to swallow his pride and do what’s best for his family leads him down a destructive road into joining a cult that jeopardizes his family. Devotion does a good job with environmental storytelling to get some of the narrative across. Red Candle’s touch hasn’t been lost at all when it comes to human stories well. My only minor nitpick is the ending is a little too abrupt but that’s fine and it fits there really isn’t any kind of denouement.

Finally if you’re wondering about the review bomb it’s a bunch of Chinese trolls getting real mad about an easter egg calling Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh. The dangers of fanatical cult-like devotion, it’s like the whole theme of this game and even part of Detention’s or something. You can’t make up this kind of irony, folks.

At first, this is not a horror game. I mean, there are some screamers and spooky moments, but it is not a horror. There is no action gameplay like Alien: Isolation (except for one moment), there's only a narrative. It is just a dark story: like Edith Finch, but scary. 
The best part of the game is good, great location design. There aren't much video games which have so much of this ""room art"", so this game is notable. This is one of the main features of the game, no doubt, and it's a shame that I can tell not too much about it because it's worth seeing.

I admire what this small studio has achieved in terms of horror - they pulled off a gripping horror game even if they're a small indie studio. Others have critisied it to be too short, which I didn't mind. I loved every minute of it! Poor Pooh isn't to blame here -- play the game and decide for yourself, I highly recommend it.

There was something terrible happened to the family and the player needs to gather all the pieces in order to get the whole picture of the story. During my first play through, I was able to figure out the misery not so far from the beginning, but it still makes me drop into the play deeply when the story goes further and further.

""Jump scare is part of the affect, but the horror pressure from the story is why I call it a nice thriller.""

The game included plenty scenes, and it is the way how the game process. Every time you make some important move, it will effect the current scene immediately,  and something strange will happened, which contains information about the story, and also makes you more and more frightened about what's going on. The game include some jump scares, but it is just making some small surprises to the player.

""The music is impressive.""

The story uses some heavy pressure bgm to make the player feeling intense just like every horror game. But they used some tradition Chinese instrument in special theme to present the age of the story, also the theme music is really nice.

""The used Taiwanese tradition culture and religion to build up the story and the scene.""

The items and the furniture are so familiar with real life in the 1980s in Taiwan. As a Taiwanese, the game additionally gave me a chance to remind those old fashion age.

49193208,1006510,Devotion,bombing,recent_all,"I thought this game was excellent (though I still haven't played Detention). I've played just about every horror game I could get my grimy claws on for at least a decade, and Devotion found its way on my list fairly quickly. I'm not Taiwanese, but I have taken Mandarin classes with Taiwanese teachers, and I learned enough over the years to pick out some of the cultural aspects the horror itself was rooted in. Obviously, I missed quite a bit, but I knew enough for my experience to be enhanced. That's not to say that if you don't know anything about Taiwanese culture - and, yes, I would argue it's distinct from mainland Chinese culture - you won't enjoy  the game. 

It's got no combat and no hiding from spooky monsters; gameplay is story-driven with some light puzzles. The scares are derived from atmosphere and from the story, itself, rather than jumpscares and gore. If that appeals to you, and you're not angry at the thought of Taiwan's independence from mainland China, then this game is for you!

Prior to purchase, I didn't know about the director's politics, but now that I know? I might buy copies for people who would enjoy this. My teachers were discouraged from saying they were Taiwanese, instead encouraged to say they're Chinese and to foster identity with a country that has moved in on their country and culture, just as the mainland moved in on Hong Kong and other Cantonese speaking areas, to the point where teenagers are abandoning the language of their culture and history in favour of Mandarin.

Like the developer's previous game Detention, Devotion is a psychological horror game set in Taiwan. I loved Detention so picking up this game on day 1 was a no-brainer. This game has a captivating story with themes of family, religion, and mental health to name a few. Graphics are great, and the sound track is excellent. Length is a bit short at about 3 hours but Dention was also about 3-4 hours so that was to be expected.

I highly recommend both this game and the previous game Detention even if you are not into horror games. Both games also provide a little insight about what life was like in 1950s and 1980s Taiwan, which is a plus.

I am not sure how bad it will be if some game has an easter egg praising the 911 or any campus massacre as glorious incidents, or hide words like ""nigger"" all over the game and ACTUALLY mean to promote hatred towards any racial group. Are they illegal? Probably not. U.S. is a nation that protects free speech. But those easter eggs will hurt the feeling of a lot of American, I believe. 

As a Chinese, I might feel that these hatred easter eggs I made up are only about ""political correctness"" and some U.S. people are overreacting. But I do know that they cares about political correctness, so I will gently respect their opinions, and will never include those content if I am the game producer. 

Looking back at the game. No body knows better than Chinese people that politics is very sensitive in China (both mainland and Taiwan). I don't like any propaganda shit-talking Taiwan, and at the same time I hope people can respect my choice to respect my country.

If you think the easter egg is hidden by some random developer that's unrelated to the RedCandleGames, I also hope that is the case. But as it turns out that there are many similar metaphors only obvious after we see the one text evidence (one that explicitly writes Xi's name). When it comes to metaphor, it is hard to argue what is their intention. But one text evidence is enough to blow everything up because it is just too sensitive a topic.

Chinese political cultists are review bombing the game because it dares make fun of Supreme God-Emperor For Life Xi-nny the Pooh. I'll write a proper review when I complete the game, but for the time being I'm gonna help against the bombing. 

So far the game is holding up on many quality levels, and the plot is intriguing me.

Actual Review:

So this is a Layers of Fear style narrative-driven horror game with some ""connect the dots"" style puzzles where you have to ""earn"" an item from one area, to use in another, or gain a clue from one item that then helps you solve something in another.

Each chapter has its own style to help freshen things up, and the story is rich and tragic. The graphics are certainly passable for the most part, in some areas looking photo-real and others not so much.

It has a good share of spooks and scares, some cliché, others not so much, either way I was thrilled playing this game.

It is entirely linear, there are no divergent paths or additional endings, which I feel like, perhaps it could have done? The story definitely needs a bit of thinking to unravel, and after completing it, I'm unsure what to conclude.

I just have a large screen and have to sit quite close to it due to my living arrangements, so it can be uncomfortable with such a restrictive FOV.

- There is no character named Lu Gongmin in the game. There's not really even a cult leader; the only character you meet who is connected to the cult is named Mentor Heuh/He Laoshi. I don't know where this is coming from unless I missed it in one of the game's news clippings.
- There isn't any explicit or even really implicit anti-CCP or anti-mainlander sentiment in the game.
- The thing about Xi Jinping being depicted as a child attacker in the game is not true. I don't know where that comes from.

I had ZERO expectations & in fact owned this game for years, never giving it a chance or moment of my time.  The FO fans had convinced me this was garbage and the worst Fallout experience you could possibly have.  FO fans clearly expressed after New Vegas, the series and everything connected to it is trash.

So I log in to FO76 and feel a bit overwhelmed with all the options & systems...few weeks later of running with friends, this game is actually amazing in many ways.  Despite not being on an Unreal engine, the atmosphere feels good.  Weather effects, storms & desolation all feels good.  You can do tons of different things I have NEVER seen combined into a survival shooter sandbox.

you can build a base, setup powered 'circuits', tons of animated furnishings, earn ATOMS via questing, crafting, groups events.  Season pass does push to subscribe, BUT there are lots of FREE things to be obtained.

All the 'fans' that hate on this game, I do get it - It's not New Vegas, there will never be another New Vegas!  However, FO76 is a fun game that gives me stalker + H1Z1 vibes.  Setting up your loot in a shop is a big part of the base-building.

Unlike ESO there are stakes and you can get killed in the overworld if you're not careful.  As for events, they are not instanced in many cases, allowing you to call in artillery strikes from your base and other strange things.

The build options, loot tables, vendors, quests & landscape have a lot to offer without paying for a subscription.  Just grabbing a burger combo at Wendy's these days costs $15 to $20 a visit, so if you do sub, they hand you tons of in-game currency & QoL = that is not required to enjoy the game, but does feel generous compared to ESO & other games of the genre.

Good game that got a lot of well-deserved cr@p for a garbage release, but is now a lot of fun with tons of ways to enjoy it.  Worth a look for sure!  I grabbed it on-sale for $7 and it's a ridiculous amount of content for that price or even at $50.",2024,375,0.0429841897233201,0.0237154150197628,2,0,0,8,0,0.0148795648795648,0.5239963739963741,1,1,0,1,1.0,2,0,1,3,14,0,174.86666666666667,192.16666666666663,202.6,0,0,1,0,11.57453297750667,0.9485027969726884,0,202.6,14.0,1,1762056948,1762063532,1,1,0,0,2,0,2541,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

1st boot: Horrible stuttering. FPS showed to be 90-109, but it was absolutely unbearable to watch. GPU utilization was around 20-30%, CPU around 12%.
2nd boot: The stuttering disappeared magically, GPU utilization jumped to 80%, CPU hangs around 12-18%. Networks issue(?) makes character stuck on it's tracks from to time. Preventing movement. After few seconds the character is able to move again normally.
3rd boot: Disabled the VPN, in case it could have cause the possible network issues. Didn't help. Still got stuck on my tracks , usually after looting something and after I finally reached The Wayward and went inside, character just stood there, unable to move in any direction. I quiet the game after a minute of standing. So I guess this is it. Good bye Fallout 76, you never became anything.

Other than those issues, I must say I do not understand this game. Because as a base game concept, it's great. Fallout with friends! But, it's in this stupid, greedy, malicious live service model. This could have been a great game, if it had been just Fallout with co-op. But no, Bethesda had to go greedy (again) and make dumdum decisions. Like, really? How do you F things up with the concept that could have been such a great thing. ""Single player game with an option to play with friends.""

On a positive side, at least it's rather pretty - for a Bethesda game. And it has gone better, since the last time I tested it; gun play feels more precise, at least.
It's just still annoying to play because of technical issues, base building mechanics (would have loved to make a permanent base anywhere I want, but because of the live service, always online, model, not a possibility).",1754,303,0.0381984036488027,0.0330672748004561,1,2,0,3,0,-0.0565873015873015,0.5679942279942279,0,0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,0,92,0,2.3833333333333333,0.8666666666666667,2.3833333333333333,0,0,1,0,735.944055944056,0.3636363636363636,0,2.3833333333333333,92.0,0,1762019123,1762019985,1,1,0,0,1,0,2541,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

208134194,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
If you’re looking for an objective review of Fallout 76 from a person who was raised on Fallout 1 & 2 - this is an ok game where you can have fun. After years of improvement I can finally recommend playing it and even buying Fallout 1st (yep). And if you’re looking for something that could change your view, take a look on the deep dive.


[h1]-Deep Dive-[/h1]

Is the hate that Fallout 76 receives justified? Yes.
Is the game a letdown for longtime Fallout fans? Partially.
Is it worth hating, blaming Bethesda for ruining the franchise and angrily accusing Todd of total destruction of a game universe we love? Well, I can’t believe I finally can say - Hell no.

[u]The Devs[/u]
Fallout 76 nowadays is a 7/10 game. The devs truly improved it, fixed lots of annoying and game breaking bugs. They’ve rebalanced the game to the point it’s actually enjoyable to play it the way you want. The unmentionable amount of bugs, glitches and crashes are no longer there and it’s thanks to the devs and great community build throughout all those years. The rebalance is there, the enjoyment is there, and most importantly, the sheer fun of playing a Fallout game can be found there. There is a catch though.

[u]The Universe[/u]
If you think that Fallout 76 is ruining the franchise - I don’t blame you. For years I thought the same and was disappointed for Bethesda allowing it. Retcons, playground approach, pastel colors, silly outfits and monetisation were annoying me for years. I truly hated Bethesda until I started to understand why.
This is not Obsidian’s dirty Post-Post-Apocalypse - a commentary of how people will always find a way to rage war and always find a cause for it. This is Bethesda’s Fallout, still the same kind of apocalypse, still the same universe, but their commentary focuses more on grotesque American Dream, consumerism and environmental storytelling. Is it disappointing it’s not the same approach? Of course it is. But is it bad that the company who took over a great franchise, want to improve on it approaching it differently, yet carefully (to some degree)? Nope.

[u]The Fallout[/u]
The apocalypse is there. The struggle to meet ends meet is there. The gritty, dirty, despicable world is there. So why myself and thousand fans are angry with Beth for “ruining the franchise”? Simple answer is that we’re either in a particular information bubble or we just feel hurt and don’t want to let go out of fear we might like it, no matter what. Everything we know and love from previous Fallouts is actually there. Factions who think their approach is best - check. Plot showing ruthlessness and insanity of pre-war corporations - check. Grotesque danger lurking in the wasteland - check. The path from radroach smasher to Supermutant eradicator- check. It’s still Fallout in its core. What we don’t accept is Bethesda’s take on it. 

[u]The Disagreement[/u]
We don’t accept the ridiculousness of the wasteland, the improvements on some plot holes, the ruining of our nostalgia. We’re basically homesick but furious that our home have been modernized. We want good old Fallout no matter what, knowing deep down it’s not possible in XXIst century. Bethesda sacrifices some parts of the franchise to basically balance the profits, old fans satisfaction and new players enjoyment. It’s not perfect but it’s either this, franchise abandonment or full focus on mainstream audience. Considering that, we’re in a pretty comfortable place.

[u]The Details[/u]
Remember the Morningstar and Kokoweef mines with their mine scrips from Fallout 2? It’s an actual side currency in 76.
G.E.C.K. technology? It’s now an actual device usable by vault dwellers as C.A.M.P.
Tragic the Garnering card game, which apparently “isn’t just a game” and “changes a person’s” life”? Level-up perk cards.
ZAX supercomputer? Present in Vault 51.
Nicknaming the character on boxing ring? Prefixes and suffixes.
Fallout 3 information about vault purposes scattered in terminals? Vault 76 purpose of studying the wasteland is mentioned on Fallout 3 Citadel terminal.
Mojave Express Dropboxes? Camp stash.
Those are all references to previous games. It’s actually impressive that they’ve been adapted as a mechanic or implemented effortlessly in this game.

[u]The Monetisation[/u]
Is Fallout 1st game breaking? Absolutely fucking not. Is it helpful? Of course. Is it worth it? It depends. You may pay $15 for WoW subscription which has immense amounts of content. Should you be ostracised? You’re paying for something which brings you fun and lets you enjoy a product with friends/similarily passionate people, that’s no waste of money. Fallout 76 doesn’t have the same amount of content, yet it’s the franchise you enjoy. 1st gives you advantage and is optional. You won’t be worse without it and you most certainly won’t be better with it. It’s a bottomless stash, fast travel tent and value in atoms spent in Atomic Shop. Sure you can buy resource generators or items giving you advantage in a way that you don’t have to search for items in the wasteland. You can also buy cosmetics and camp items. Nonetheless, it won’t give you an edge over other players because there is no competition, no chasing leaderboards. You pay only for stuff you want to see more often or stuff that helps you with chore-like item hoarding. It’s not necessary, it’s got good value in in Atomic Shop currency and just makes the game a tad more comfortable. That’s it.

[u]The Self-hatred[/u]
There’s lots of things I didn’t mention intentionally. Bugs, illusion of choice, legendary weapons, battle pass. I didn’t mention them because they either don’t influence my enjoyment at all or just on a minimal scale. I often heard “why are you playing this again, you said it’s shit”. Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. The default hate was comfortable, but it’s still a product with Fallout in its name. I’m a die hard Fallout fan and wanted to understand what makes me so mad about this product. I’m glad I did because the deep dive proved me wrong. I enjoy it because it’s Fallout, and I hated it because I felt let down like somebody dissected my favourite franchise and taxidermised it by Chuck Testa*. It wasn’t. It was modernized with care.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
This wall of text is from a long time fan of the franchise, a person who put some effort to understand why, and let go of the mainstream hate. You don’t have to agree with my opinion, hell, you can continue hating it. Just make sure you hate it for the good reasons and not just simple - OPINIONS. OPINIONS NEVER CHANGES.
7/10, will play it, will come back to it periodically, will look forward to future improvements.

208129391,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"Fallout 76 is severely overhated. I get that it had a bad launch but I feel people just make fun of the game now because of the state of it's launch just being a meme. Yes it was buggy, yes it was boring and yes it was extremely rushed but most of (not all) all these problems are long gone. Fallout 76 as of November 2025 when I write this review is a genuinely fun and interesting game that expands upon the gameplay mechanics of Fallout 4. It's so visually mesmerizing to see fallout in a somewhat modern graphical fidelity. Fallout 76 has a very interesting story too. Everybody who makes the same foolish stance ""fAllOuT 76 hAs nO sToRy bRo"" suffers from severe mental retardation because when I played the game and went through all the Responder holotapes and slowly uncovered what really happened to them, what happened to the Brotherhood of Steel, what happened to the enclave, i genuinely felt a somber feeling witnessing it for the first time. Fallout 76 has so much interesting lore inside of it that is expanded upon. Im not going to talk about it too much but basically you find out more about the foundation of the brotherhood, more about the Enclave's 'purity' goal, but most importantly you actually get to feel resentment towards the first hand witnesses of the Great War. You get to see how people reminisce about their time living as a human before the war (25 years ago), with their families, friends, all gone. How all of humanities greatest achievments amounted to nothing. Just large irradiated craters in the dirt.  (minor spoiler alert) Me personally the most interesting thing I found in the game was when the Non-Enclave members of the United States Cabinet arrived at the Whitesprings bunker, a place with the intention to safeguard all the important government officials away from the bombs the Enclave executed every last one. Even though they weren't irradiated, even though they were active United States Secretaries and various other important figures they were still viewed as 'muties' or 'unpure'. Anyways just to conclude, please please please don't listen to the incels and be consumed by this overarching shroud of negativity directed towards this game for no apparent reason. The game is really good 99/100 must recommend!!!",2263,386,0.0203269995581087,0.0132567388422448,3,0,0,1,0,0.1178323412698412,0.4766369047619048,1,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,2,0,65.16666666666667,86.1,86.1,0,1,1,1,34.72634271099744,1.0,0,86.1,2.0,1,1762001763,1762001763,0,1,0,0,2,0,2540,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

208060903,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"Hi Bethesda team,

I’ve been playing Fallout since I was young — it’s more than just a game to me, it’s part of my memories. Fallout 76 has a world I really love, especially the building and exploration parts.

I just want to share this sincerely: I understand how much effort and passion your team puts into this game. I truly appreciate all the hard work from the developers and writers — it’s not easy to keep a live game running and improving.

Still, I hope you can take another look at the balance between the Fallout 1st membership and Atom Store prices. I don’t mind spending money to support the game, but right now, some prices feel a bit too high for what players receive. Features like the Scrap Box or larger storage being behind a paywall can make some of us feel limited.

Please don’t take this as a complaint — it’s just honest feedback from someone who really loves Fallout and wants it to keep growing. I hope one day the game’s support options can feel more rewarding and fair for everyone.

Thank you again for everything you’ve done for Fallout 76. Even with its flaws, it’s still one of the games closest to my heart.

— A player who still loves this world ❤️",1182,218,0.0219966159052453,0.0160744500846023,0,0,0,7,2,0.0693198468198468,0.5112912087912087,1,0,0,1,0.0,1,0,0,0,1,0,75.43333333333334,99.25,99.25,0,1,1,1,15.669465311533362,1.0,0,99.25,1.0,1,1761929053,1761929053,0,1,0,0,3,0,2540,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

Because as a true Bethesda connoisseur, I knew what to expect from their games. Crashes, bugs, glitches, you know the gist. So I waited a few years and bought it at a 7.99$ sale and it was in relative good working condition. For all their faults, I must give credit to the developers for pushing forward a game that had one of the worst starts in gaming history, up there with Assassin's Creed Unity and Cyberpunk. Also as much as I hate to admit it, a part of Bethesda's games charm are the little bugs and glitches that are not gamebreaking but are rather goofy. You do built a strong love-hate relationship with this kind of games. If you can forgive your ex, you can forgive yourself for playing Fallout 76. So do I recommand this game.

short version, this IS NOT a fallout game, this is what an idiotic attempt at a fallout game from people who only know fallout from word of mouth.

I won't comment on gameplay, since it's just fallout 4 with mechanics that make no sense.

But the lore, by god what havae they done. The factions are caricatures of what they actually are, the brotherhood of steel, a proud entity hell bent on not repeating the mistakes of their fathers, armed to the teeth and extremely xenophobic, somehow and only a handfull of years after their creation, are welcoming and want to make the wasteland something better, they also used raider armor and pipe weapons, this is the same brotherhood that has SAMs and airships.
the responders are what a 10 year thinks of heros. spend a second thinking ""HUH, how does that even work?"" and you'll see what i mean, ""medics firefighter and cops trying to help as best they can"" but when you visit their sites there isn't a hint of how those units operate, they were written by what an outsider thinks those people should be.
The scorched, a massive threat to life itself, is somehow sensitive to a mineral that never existed while the virus was being developed, this is prime example of ""random bullshit go""
The evil corporations, this one is a disaster, they are cartoon level villains, not masterminds running corps worth billions, this was obv written by a socialist moron that never saw jobs in real life, look up the quest for project motherlode and you'll see what i mean.

they butchered the universe, its no longer what F1 2 and NV had.

My brother: [i]""Yeah, let's stop.""[/i]

When we stopped playing the game in 2023, [b]Fallout 76[/b] had received countless patches, content drops, questlines, side characters and [i]battle passes[/i].
The game had become a hodgepodge of varying quality in almost all aspects and more and more you could see the seams of a game that was becoming rapidly incoherent with every new update.

Yes, when the game released it was not done.
It had a half-baked battle royale mode stacked on top, because that was ""the big thing"" at the time, before it was patched out at some point, early in its live service life.
Back then there was not a single living friendly npc in the game, despite a ton of holotapes, journal entries and an insane amount of world building. No living quest givers existed for quite a while in [b]76[/b] and that was a crazy break from what Fallout had been up to that point.
But that didn't matter to my brother and I!
We could finally play Fallout together and despite how basic our experience was compared to earlier games in the series, we still spent countless hours devouring every little thing we could find.

Here's the thing, [b]Fallout 76[/b]'s original, version 1.0, game package was designed around the limitation it still had back then. There were lore reasons why the map was devoid of friendly human life. It made sense. It wasn't deus ex machina nonsene. It kept making sense as you progressed through the varying areas and interesting locales. Kept making sense with every new little tidbit of information or world building.
But with every new live service update that changed.
It lost part of its original appeal. Or idea.
That original experience had been bulldozed over countless times when we were still playing the game and that bulldozer has not stopped once, as [b]76[/b] keeps being a very lucrative game for Bethesda, as they keep re-releasing the same two games for all eternity.

[b]Fallout 76[/b]'s world doesn't make sense anymore.
But it also can't remove any of the new things to allow you to witness that original experience. And in the same vein, it also can't remove what was originally there, because everything is stacked on top of that.

I loved that original [b]Fallout 76[/b].
I've made so many memories in its first or so year, that I'll probably never remember all of them.
You can go back and play that original [b]Fallout 3[/b] or [b]New Vegas[/b].
But you cannot play the [b]Fallout 76[/b] that I love.",2526,433,0.0178147268408551,0.0205859065716547,1,0,0,6,0,0.0305745102355271,0.4747028395333479,0,1,1,0,0.5,2,0,0,0,56,610,202.65,0.0,202.65,0,0,0,0,12.464840858623242,0.0,0,0.3322131147540983,0.0918032786885245,1,1761832218,1761832218,0,0,0,0,1,0,2539,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

207918066,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"Review: Fallout 76 (Wastelanders Update)

I’ve been playing Fallout 76 for a while now, and it really reminds me of the classic Fallout experience — in the best possible way. With the Wastelanders Update, the game finally became a full, proper Fallout title.

The return of real NPCs, dialogue choices, and meaningful factions brought back the heart of what makes Fallout special. Quests feel personal again, decisions matter, and Appalachia now feels alive and worth exploring.

On Steam, performance is stable, and the combination of the C.A.M.P. system, Legendary Perks, and regular events offers plenty to do without feeling like a grind. The world looks great, the atmosphere is strong, and there’s always something new to discover.

What surprised me most is the community — genuinely friendly and helpful players, which is rare in online games.

Verdict: Fallout 76 has finally become what it was always meant to be — a true Fallout experience with multiplayer elements. If you enjoy the series, it’s absolutely worth jumping back in.

⭐ Rating: 8 / 10 – Recommended, especially since Wastelanders.


Review Update: Fallout 76 – Brotherhood of Steel (Steel Dawn / Steel Reign)

The Brotherhood of Steel expansions turned Fallout 76 into something truly close to the single-player Fallout feeling many players had been missing. With Steel Dawn and Steel Reign, Bethesda added a strong narrative backbone — full of moral choices, solid writing, and that familiar Brotherhood tension between idealism and control.

The quests are well-paced, the voice acting fits the faction perfectly, and new locations like Fort Atlas feel authentic within Appalachia’s world. Equipment upgrades, new weapons, and armor sets make progression satisfying without breaking balance.

Performance and stability continue to improve, and the Brotherhood story adds a sense of purpose to the late game. It finally feels like your character has a reason to keep exploring beyond daily events.

Verdict: A great addition that deepens Fallout 76’s lore and atmosphere. Whether you side with or against the Brotherhood, this DLC gives the game the narrative depth it always deserved.

⭐ Rating: 8.5 / 10 – Recommended for anyone who enjoys Fallout’s classic factions and moral gray",2259,357,0.0332005312084993,0.0239043824701195,0,0,0,13,2,0.2147352647352647,0.4781151540766926,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1,1,23,370,130.43333333333334,84.18333333333334,144.81666666666666,0,0,0,0,17.319192435471503,0.5813097019219704,0,0.3913963963963964,0.0621621621621621,1,1761782284,1762000242,1,1,0,0,1,0,2538,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

207829165,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"I felt more engaged writing this review than I did in ~15 hours of giving this game a chance. 

The word ""slop"" is thrown around a lot these days, but Fallout 76 is the very definition of inoffensive, sterile, commercial slop. It's like going home, and finding out your favourite spot is now a Starbucks.

It's a treadmill of banal, meaningless content that just serves to pass time. You're not being challenged. You're not even thinking. Nothing is a threat, everything is level scaled. I never once died to an enemy. I rarely even had to heal. You fight enemies, to make number go up. You pick up litter, to build stuff, to make number go up. It's a pointless cyclical ritual.

It's so diluted it's insulting. Things that were unlocked by default in Fallout 4, in crafting and settlement building, are now chopped off and thrown into loot tables for you to (very slowly) find. Everything is a grind, everything is tedious. It feels like that's the entire point of the game, too. 

It's an incredibly static and lifeless game. Everything happened before you got there. All of the stories I found, were the same flavour of ""my boss is a dick"" that was tired back in Fallout 3. It's uninteresting. Why should I care? These people are all dead and the world ended. Throw me into a story that's actively happening. Let me shape it. That's Fallout.

76 is a terrible multiplayer game, on top of all this. You don't share quests, so everyone is playing their own game, just in a shared space. If you see other people, most of the time you just ignore them. They can't hurt you, or really help you, outside of just dropping you a bunch of free items you really don't need anyway.

I could go on, but this game doesn't deserve it. It's dull, tedious, and soulless. You could pick up 2-3 indie games for this price that were made by people with passion and heart, that would be a way better use of your limited time on this Earth.

If you really need to kill time this bad, idk man learn a skill.

I started playing Fallout 76 recently, and I’ll be honest — I didn’t expect to enjoy it this much. The game still captures that unique Fallout feeling: the atmosphere, the music, the weird NPCs, the silence of the wasteland — it all feels right.

I love building my CAMP and exploring every corner of Appalachia. The new Ghoul Update is amazing — becoming a ghoul adds a fresh layer of immersion. When I do faction quests, I even hide my identity… it just feels right for the character.

Still, Fallout 76 isn’t perfect. PvP is basically dead, and even though it’s an MMORPG, all quests are solo only. It’s disappointing when I play with friends — we pick the same quest, but the game sends us into separate solo instances. If I wanted to do every mission alone, I’d just play single-player Fallout.

But even with all its flaws, there’s something special here. The world feels alive, and the community is one of the friendliest I’ve ever seen in an online game.

If you love Fallout and want to experience its world with others — even if it’s not a perfect MMO — Fallout 76 is still worth every hour.

⭐ 8/10 – Enclave forever. Glory to the Old World.

🇬🇷 Fallout 76 – Enclave για πάντα. Δόξα στον Παλαιό Κόσμο.

Ξεκίνησα να παίζω πρόσφατα το Fallout 76 και ειλικρινά δεν περίμενα να μου αρέσει τόσο. Το παιχνίδι κρατάει ακόμα αυτό το μοναδικό Fallout συναίσθημα: η ατμόσφαιρα, η μουσική, οι παράξενοι NPCs, η σιωπή της ερημιάς — όλα είναι στη θέση τους.

Λατρεύω να χτίζω το CAMP μου και να εξερευνώ κάθε γωνιά της Appalachia. Το νέο Ghoul Update είναι εξαιρετικό — το να γίνεσαι ghoul δίνει άλλη αίσθηση στον ρόλο. Όταν κάνω αποστολές με φατρίες, κρύβω την ταυτότητά μου… γιατί έτσι ταιριάζει στον χαρακτήρα μου.

Όμως το Fallout 76 δεν είναι τέλειο. Το PvP είναι ουσιαστικά νεκρό, και παρότι θεωρείται MMORPG, όλες οι αποστολές είναι μόνο για solo. Είναι απογοητευτικό να ξεκινάς την ίδια αποστολή με έναν φίλο και να σας στέλνει σε ξεχωριστά instances. Αν ήθελα να τα κάνω όλα μόνος, θα έπαιζα ένα single-player Fallout.

Παρά τα ελαττώματά του όμως, έχει κάτι ξεχωριστό. Ο κόσμος του μοιάζει ζωντανός και η κοινότητα είναι από τις πιο φιλικές που έχω δει σε online παιχνίδι.

Αν αγαπάς το Fallout και θέλεις να ζήσεις την εμπειρία του με άλλους, ακόμα κι αν δεν είναι το τέλειο MMO — το Fallout 76 αξίζει κάθε ώρα.

The framerate is capped, but with some strange interpolation that makes mouse aim feel floaty and brought on motion sickness within an hours play. This can be resolved by editing the settings .ini file, but then all movement input stops randomly due to the framerate being too high...
What a mess. The simple, easy to use menus and build system from fallout 4 are gone, replaced with a miserable, confusing and inconsistent UI experience. Then there's the paywalls - no private games unless you fork over cash. *Wonderful*.
On the plus side, the quests are interesting (even though the tutorial is shockingly bad) and the new perk/level up system is different and refreshingly good. Enemy design is at least interesting, and combat is fun (at least at early levels). The dynamic events are a great touch, and the huge map is packed with details.

PROS:
+ Events are fun Fallout style chaos
+ The community is really friendly
+ PVP has been made possible but not ""default""
+ You get to build and decorate your C.A.M.P
+ You can buy instruments and start the bad you have dreamed of since being a teenager
+ Hey, it's a damn MMORPG Fallout!

CONS:
- The default controls are worse than in any other game (you will get used to them)
- Although the game receives bug fixes it can still be buggy, and often crash when you launch it if you open it ""too fast""
- The main story is really boring (but the side quests and events compensate that)
- You can have almost any pet (which is +) but they won't be able to follow you :(

You can build a house and there's a glorious wide assortment of stuff to decorate your house with. All cool. BUT! Your house is only visible when you're in the game - and it seems if you place the house somewhere close to where another player has placed theirs, and you two are in the game at the same time, your house is just... gone if the other player logged on before you (I assume this is the logical order of things). This happened to me, I had a message telling me it could no longer place my home base, so I was given a second location ""for free""... Well, hooray for that... :/

Also - and again, I am a noob in the game - but it seems to me that this is sort of a ""single player game with other players"", in that missions were tied to your character, there's no cooperative team missions, no tasks that we as a team do together. So it's kind of a weird mix of classic Fallout and a multiplayer game.

All in all I would not directly NOT recommend this game - it's just Steam that's limited to either YAY or NAY, but don't expect the most polished MP game out there, is what I'm saying. It's kind of an oddball of a mix of genres on top of a house building system that really is quite questionable when you risk losing it all unless you place it somewhere noone else would think of building their home.

- Very casual friendly game, you don't need top gear to do events. can literally afk and still get rewards.
- Beginner friendly and helpful community.
- Can pay for free and not spend a dime if you don't care about cosmetics

- Constant back and forth nerfs/buffs to loadouts and weapons every 2-3 months

Then had a break from the game and came back recently ( Oct 2025) after hearing that there was a new expansion due . What a  major disappointment!!!! So, i made a new character ( thinking it had been awhile ) BUT now everything levels with you , so your first job to Morgan town and instead of being mob by 20+ lvl 5s - its 20+ lvl 19s my level - me my single shot pipe pistol and my crappy machete - DEAD - again - and so it went on, massively tedious and frustrating given that weapons lvl only rise every 10 lvls.  So following the Overseers mission was just the same over and over - Hunterville a town filled with super Mutants with missile launcher & minigun - used to be lvl 16s now they are all lvl 50s and over powered at that , sneak hide, shoot, die - 1 shotted. Pushed on managed to join the Enclave and build some  0-x1 power armor - smiling!!!! - until a regular scorchbeast came along and melted in within 1.30 mins, no amount of pumping simpacks could save me- Damn long walk back to pick up that little paper bag with all my dropped crap in it. Now 120 and the lvl 100 Snagglygasters and Toxic larrys punish me to within an inch of my life - again way over powered as i used to belt them dead with my ALL RISE no problem - and so it goes on everything is lvl 100 and nothing is fun. And i can see by my little achievements sticker i am not the only one feeling this way - basic ones show only 13,9% , 17% 14% of player reach them - tiny % - Bethesda is obviously are not interested in new players - so dont waste your money here. I read tons of new guides , and all they talk about is Legendary Mods (which need lots of time to get together to buy) and the new weapons that you can only get plans with Bullion - but you need to be able to survive the story - which is single player.  So sad - am a total Fallout fans with over 2000 hours on Fallout 4 - they have turned a fun game ( even for solo players) into a tedious grind with impossible goals - like yeah i will just pull this set of T65 out of my arse- because it only took me 2 years to get the first set - i am sure that Scorchbeast will just wait over there for me - or the 30+ Lvl 100 mole miners now lurking at Welsch station - save your money and sanity new players -  look somewhere else",2385,487,0.0184486373165618,0.0113207547169811,8,0,0,1,0,0.0030181149432328,0.5233645809117505,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,1,3,0,216.0,80.28333333333333,237.7333333333333,0,1,1,1,11.041666666666666,0.3377033090297252,0,237.7333333333333,3.0,1,1761533445,1761533445,0,0,0,0,3,0,2535,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

But last season, they added something that's been pretty much setting my PC on fire. Loading into the game, loading into a map, approaching an area... My PC has never stuttered so bad before. Sometimes it even causes the monitor i'm playing it on to just gives up and go full digital static.

Honestly the hours on my account does say that I enjoyed my time in this game. But I was just suddenly hit with massive performance issues that I didn't have before. I've tried various gfx drivers, no difference. Everything else on my PC works fine. So i'm just figurin' it was a game patch that broke something.

Edit: It says I received this product for free... I did not... I purchased this day 1.

In the two times I've had two different PC configurations, this game has always given me problems. The classic problems of poor optimization; such as shuttering and frame drops. Before, I had a PC with a Ryzen 2600X, RX 570 GB and 16 GB of RAM. Now AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, AMD RX 6600 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM. Well, not much has changed. Obviously, I've tried solutions, but in the end, none of them seem to definitively solve the problems (or alleviate them). I play Cyberpunk 2077 on high details at 1080p, 144hertz without any problems. I played the same thing again on Death Stranding 1 on high details, 1080p, without any problems. This is clearly a Fallout 76 problem. Too bad, it would have interesting things to offer. But Bethesda is that clown company that, instead of fixing the problems, just continues to add new content to the already heavy game in its 100 GB of storage.

Sadly, depending on the day, when the game starts, it will almost immediately boot you out with a 
""Disconnected from Server"" message. No amount of retrying helps, just end up waiting for several days until it randomly lets me back in.... No explanation, no support topics... Infuriating. I'm tempted to try for a refund and wait until they fix the bug or get enough servers online...
I couldn't recommend this game with such a glaring technical flaw.

[b]Wrong.[/b]

This game is a complete and utter technical and visual disaster.
You don't even NEED to be a *Fallout* fan to hate this garbage. You just need to be someone who enjoys framerates that exist above ""slideshow"" and graphics that don't look like they're actively disintegrating.

[b]PROS:[/b]

* [b]The Nicest Community:[/b] Honest to God, I'm shocked by how nice and helpful the community is. By far the nicest MMORPG community I've ever met. (And not the creepy ""Herbert the Pervert"" kind like in *Final Fantasy XIV*). High-level players seem to just hand out gear to new players.
* [b]The Sale Price:[/b] At least I only wasted a few bucks and not the full $60.

[b]CONS:[/b]

* [b]PERFORMANCE DISASTER:[/b] This is the #1 reason. I'm on a 9800 X3D, an RTX 5090, 128GB of RAM and a Gen 4 NVMe SSD. My PC is NOT the problem. This game is.

    The framerate is an unstable, vomit-inducing mess. It shows 160 highs and 32 lows and *never* once felt smooth except when I entered instanced interiors. It constantly feels like it's running at 25 FPS regardless of what the counter says.

https://i.imgur.com/Ga79QEE.png

* [b]IT LOOKS LIKE ASS:[/b] The performance isn't just bad; the game is hideous.
    * [b]Abysmal LoD:[/b] You can watch entire buildings and mountains pop into existence 40 feet in front of you.
    * [b]Broken Shadows:[/b] There is weird distracting shadow checkerboxing on almost every surface especially noticeable on brightly colored buildings.
    * [b]Constant Pop-in:[/b] Rocks, forests and junk just appear out of thin air as you walk. It's pretty immersion-breaking.

https://i.imgur.com/cfYpDo7.jpeg

This looks way worse than Fallout 4. Honestly it looks even worse than New Vegas in a lot of regards. Keep in mind that this garbage came out during the same year as Marvel's Spider-Man, God of War, Detroit: Become Human, etc.

* [b]GAME-BREAKING JANK:[/b] In just two hours, I've seen constant AI desync, AI teleporting to me, AI turning invisible, and AI getting stuck on geometry like stairs or a house's wall.

It feels like a pre-alpha from 2015 and not a ""fixed"" game from 2025.

[b]THE FALLOUT 1ST ""FIX"" IS A LIE:[/b]
I even bought one month of Fallout 1st. I figured, ""Okay, maybe the public servers are just dying from the *Fallout* TV show popularity?""

[b]Yeah, nevermind. It runs exactly the same.[/b]

The core game engine is just a 7-year-old turd. Paying Bethesda a monthly fee doesn't fix the optimization, it doesn't fix the abysmal graphics, and it doesn't fix the broken AI. It just gives you a magic junk box inside a game that runs like one.

[b]RATINGS:[/b] 3/10

[b]BOTTOM LINE:[/b]
My PC can run a space rocket to the moon. It cannot, apparently, get a stable framerate or load assets correctly in this 2018 game.

I genuinely don't understand how people can lower their standards enough to tolerate this level of jank and visual garbage long enough to get to level 600+. The only explanation is that the community is just that good. And they did genuinely give me great vibes.

It's the same old Bethesda story for the last 10 years: a technically garbage game that is uniquely saved by its awesome community. The ""it's fixed now"" narrative is a total lie.

I play with a 4080 super and 32 gb of DDR5. The stuttering 'jitteryness' of the graphics is unacceptable. The graphics themselves are dated, which is expected from Bethesda. The quests so far have been straight ass. Random raiders and settlers with no though made to their persons whatsoever. Sometimes houses and buildings do not load properly and youll see random items floating in a half empty house, with AI settlers staring mindlessly into a random corner. Some enemies take no damage because they are part of quests, guess the game isnt really open world then is it.The nickle and dime nature of the atom shop is incredibly off putting, like really, slight updates to existing assets from previous games and your charging for them? The gunplay is mid, even compared to Fo4. There seems to be, from my point of view, a clear push to make the game seem as addicting as possible, in a manner by which players will shovel out more money to 'get to the good parts'. I will probably play for at least 10 hours more before updating this review, with friends, but as of now this game seems incredibly scummy.

With the recent update FO76 had I simply do not understand why they changed the building menu and the overall experience. It's terrible at least in my opinion. The fact that when you choose an item and then place it and then if it gets placed by accident or just want to edit it you have to exit out of the current highlighted item and then press ""LS"" button (I'm using a controller) to then highlight the item to then remove or move the item. I do not understand what the devs were thinking. It's my only complaint so far. I do not like the way they changed it. Overall again my original review stands clear on what I think about the game. I recommend the game but I won't recommend the overall experience the game has changed into in terms of building your base. 


I played for several years since this game came out, and at first, it was great. I actually enjoyed playing this game. Still, I can't get into the game, and not because the game is bad; the story is actually good. However, many things make the game unplayable. For example, this game came out 5 years ago and still lacks cross-progression or cross-platform play, whereas many games in this genre offer one or the other, or both. It blows my mind how the devs do not implement that yet. Overall, the gameplay is what you expect from a Fallout game, but it feels constrained by the ancient engine it runs on. The constant bugs and performance issues, even after years of patches, are a nagging reminder that the technical foundation is simply not suited for a modern online, open-world experience.

It's a game of two halves: a genuinely engaging post-apocalyptic world and story that manages to pull you back in, contrasted with a frustrating, archaic infrastructure that is struggling to support a live-service model. The lack of basic modern features like cross-progression isn't just an oversight; it's a symptom of a larger technical hurdle that the developers have admitted is difficult to clear, which leaves dedicated long-time players feeling ignored and essentially forces you to choose a single platform, further segmenting an already niche player base.

You stick with it for the unique blend of exploration and lore, but the persistent jankiness, server instability, and archaic quality-of-life failings are the trade-off, and for many, that trade-off is finally becoming too much to bear. I will continue to play this game and actually do recommend it, but it's just many things, as I mentioned make the game sometimes unbearable to play. I hope they continue to add more and fix it.",2676,469,0.0134529147982062,0.0190582959641255,0,0,0,4,0,-0.0303296703296703,0.455054945054945,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,1,67,127,9.25,3.15,10.216666666666669,0,0,0,0,289.2972972972973,0.3083197389885807,0,0.0804461942257217,0.5275590551181102,0,1761340033,1761602635,1,0,0,0,2,0,2533,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144,6,Mostly Positive,54270,20144

207441286,1151340,Fallout 76,bombing,recent_all,"Definitely one of the worst launches in Bugthesda's storied history but also for the Fallout Franchise until Starmid came along and swept that all away. After many little updates and a decent amount of major ones with another coming soon alongside Season 2 of the show in December FO76 has come a long way to being a rather decent title in the franchise. It sadly retains the MMO/Live service parts in the game although they are light I'd rather they just not really exist but what can you do. 

However the main story and updates that brought new stories to Appalachia are rather good and I actually do reccomend playing this either solo or in a small group and just take in what West Virginia has to offer in a very beautiful and varied environments. 

The gunplay is retained from FO4 and while it is good for FO4 it does feel they could of perfected it further, here it still can feel floaty and not beefy in both feel and audio. I will say the variety of weapons added are good although it does puzzle me why we haven't had more classic Fallout weapons such as the Chinese Assualt Rifle, .32 special revolver, 9MM pistol to name a few which sucks. 

Overall I would recommend highly on sale of 70% or more off as I reckon with the free major updates and new and continued events alongside one of the genuinely best, caring, kind, and friendliest communities I have ever experienced in video games you can't really go wrong with Fallout 76 these days.

Also won't someone on YT make a solid video doing a update on how far this game has come from it's launch I think streamers and the public are getting false ideas from outdated videos such as the InternetHistorian (the Plagiarizer he is) video that this game is still absolute dogwater of which it is not.

I often felt as though my only real chance to win was through cheesy tactics and exploitative strategies. Additionally the more recent attempts to retract gameplay features and place them behind a paywall is absolutely unacceptable.

Perhaps even worse however is the behavior of the dev. Receiving political rants via the patch notes is obnoxious and inappropriate. If the game was an explicitly political one I would understand, but to use the patch notes of your video game as a podium from which to spread a political agenda is something I have no intention to put up with. I would refund the game if I could.

121607711,535230,Domina,bombing,recent_all,"[i]Panem et circenses,[/i] or bread and circuses, originates from Rome in [i]Satire X[/i] by Roman satirical poet Juvenal. In context, Bread and Circuses identifies the only remaining interest of a Roman populace that no longer cares for its historical birthright of political involvement. Here Juvenal displays his contempt for the declining heroism of contemporary Romans, using a range of different themes, including lust for power and desire for old age to illustrate his argument. Roman politicians passed laws in 140 CE to keep the votes of poorer citizens by introducing a grain dole; giving out cheap food and entertainment, ""bread and circuses,"" became the most effective way to rise to power. The phrase was and is used to imply an erosion or ignorance of a population's civic duty as a priority. Fitting, then, that the greatest modern proponent of a game glorifying that very act of ignorance has the same ignorance and eroded sense of public duty in all things.

In the early 3rd century CE, the Christian writer Tertullian condemned the attendance of Christians to attend gladiatorial games. The combats, he said, were murder, their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful, and the gladiator an instrument of pagan human sacrifice. 
[quote=Dr. Carolyn Osiek]The reason, we would suppose, would be primarily the bloodthirsty violence, but his is different: the extent of religious ritual and meaning in them, which constitutes idolatry. Although Tertullian states that these events are forbidden to believers, the fact that he writes a whole treatise to convince Christians that they should not attend [i](De Spectaculis)[/i] shows that apparently not everyone stayed away from them.[/quote]

In 325, Constantine the Great forbade criminals being forced to fight to the death as gladiators, declaring their sentence to serve in mines or other service that they may serve a real purpose with their blood. As the years went on, more Roman emperors would gradually ban the games further and further, including in the wake of Saint Telemachus' martyrdom by spectators at a gladiator [i]munus.[/i] Less than a century later, interest in gladiator combats had waned throughout the Roman empire, deemed an utter waste of money and a vile practice with no meaning nor glory.

In the Byzantine empire, the post-transition Roman empire, theatrical shows and chariot races would attract the crowds instead, drawing a generous imperial subsidy, but the gladiators would never find purpose again.

Then out of nowhere it starts popping up in my library news feed. Fair enough, looked like a lot of drama that I wasn't going to bother digging into. 

Latest update just appears to be either trolling or staunchly phobic or in the process of a very public mental breakdown? If the dev wants to work that hard at being offensive for a 4-year-old game that hasn't seen any substantial updates or additions in all that time, it only seems fair that for my belated review I give it a downvote. If this dev had been this public about being this offensive in 2018 I would have given it a pass anyway.

Aside from that, the actual game itself is actually pretty good, but there is still some severe criticism. Previously, there were gladiator classes that were locked behind the latest end-game tier research, meaning that they were very easily missed, and often underused. The developer decided to make these classes available to use at the very beginning of the game, but locked them behind a paywall, essentially stripping content from the game and repackaging it as DLC.

TL:DR If the developer's bigotry isn't enough to put you off from buying this game, his behavior and conduct as a developer should be more than enough to give you second thought. As an other reviewer had put it: The update log isn't your personal blog post, its a fucking update log. You're not writing update logs to make people laugh, persuade them, or whatever the fuck he's doing. You write update logs to *Drumroll* log your updates.

So if you own this game, it means your steam news will be filled with anti-trans, pro-MAGA, and conspiracy theory posts.

121590876,535230,Domina,bombing,recent_all,"Honestly, I really enjoyed the game and if the circumstances weren't so bad, I'd have recommended the game whole heartedly.

But with the circumstances the way they are, I cannot recommend you spend money on this game.

To summarise things:
- The dev liked to put political comments in with the patch notes for the game and whether or not they were jokes or completely serious, he received a lot of backlash for the recent one about telling people to take their masks off, in the middle of a pandemic, i might add, to which the dev decided he wanted to die on that hill and double and triple downed 

- This led to a downward spiral where the dev would decide to abuse the people who left negative reviews or comments around his statements from the patch notes and when that doesn't give the results he wanted then he would report the review or ban the person from commenting on the forum. This led to valve removing his ability to completely control his community hub because he was actively harassing his community because they didn't share his point of view on everything, he had a bit more of a meltdown and decided to stop updating the game on steam.

- The dev ended up having a huge tirade on twitter that also included abusing anyone who disagreed with his opinion and blocking them when he couldn't come up with good enough comebacks, throwing in homophobic and transphobic comments to anyone who even seemed related to those communities. 

Do I recommend the game? Yes, it is a good game and although a bit difficult the first few times you play through, there is a satisfaction to completing the game with out losing any of your gladiators.

Do I recommend you buy the game? No, The dev is acting like a child and refuses to accept his attitude is the reason for this whole mess, he has also made an attempt at a cash grab by taking things that were already in the beta branch for the base game and repackaged them into paid DLC without changing anything about them. I don't say this lightly but if you can pirate the game, then pirate it, because I don't believe this person deserves your money.

Edit: The dev has now decided that the best course of action instead of apologising to his community, to double down again in the most recent patch notes (1st Sept 2022) and slightly change the name of the game as well as poke fun at the trans community. Here is the notes in case they get removed in the future:

The combat is really low-effort and simple when you take over your units, and when you don't control them the AI is pretty bad and not really fun to watch. The management aspect feels more timer-y than fun and management-y, and mostly ends up boiling down to grinding basic stats so you can keep destroying all the lousy AI's competition with direct control, until random RNG catches up to you.

Shots land the way your crosshair says they should, movement has a clean rhythm, and smokes and flashes reward actual planning instead of guesswork. The new tech makes clutches feel steady under pressure, and a good execute is as satisfying as ever.

There are off nights. Matchmaking ranges from solid to puzzling, and cheater stories never fully disappear. Even so, a small bit of practice and a regular duo turn the curve into momentum.

208341115,730,Counter-Strike 2,bots|bombing,recent_all,"Shit game! In this modern era of games, specially FPSs, not having ADS and ""bullets flying away in every direction"" makes the game not playable for me. It was good back in the 1.6 and source days but back then those were all we had in case of PVP FPSs! I know some people may get pissed off about my comment on guns recoils so let me explain : In other FPS games (R6, COD, etc) when you ADS (which you cant even do that in CS) and shoot, the gun moves and your crosshair in the gun's sight goes up and you can control it by pulling your mouse down and then, YOUR BULLETS HIT WHERE YOU'RE AIMING AT! but in CS, your bullets start flying in every direction after the 1st bullet and only your hip-fire cross hair (sooooo realistic that they never ADS with AK an M4 cause you know, THEY DON'T ADS IN REAL LIFE SO THAT'S SOOOO REALISTIC) goes nuts in every direction which makes it impossible to control which ends up with situations like you firing a gun slowly and 1 bullet every 1 sec to make sure that it hits where you aim (which it absolutely doesn't!). CS fans defend this by saying it's for the realistic aspect of the game, which to that I say: WHY CAN'T I FACKIN ADS IF ITS REALISTIC? THERE'S LITERALLY AN IRON SIGHT IN TOP OF MY GUN AND I CAN'T USE IT TO ADS? DON'T YOU ADS WHEN YOU SHOOT A REAL GUN? So overall, IMO this game is only alive because of the people who trade CS skins, the 30 yos who play for nostalgia and ape-heads who don't want to learn to play an actual good FPS and want only gun-fight (which this game sucks at THAT, too!)",1549,304,0.157520981278244,0.0161394448030987,5,3,0,1,0,0.0091970121381886,0.4575746965452849,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,18,74,171.31666666666666,7.516666666666667,171.31666666666666,0,0,0,0,9.041735577390796,0.0438758634108376,0,2.31509009009009,0.2432432432432432,1,1762200018,1762200282,1,1,0,0,1,0,766,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,2102567,327398,8,Very Positive,2102567,327398

CS2 right now feels like standing in a hurricane made of trade ups and broken dreams. The new gold trade up system has completely flipped the market on its head. Billions gone, collectors crying, traders panicking, everyone mashing F5 on Buff trying to figure out what anything’s worth anymore. It’s madness. And yet, it’s kind of glorious. Every time I throw five red skins into the void, my heart rate doubles, and the chance of gold feels like pure electricity. The game itself looks gorgeous, plays like I’m gliding through butter, and still crashes just often enough to remind me Valve hates stability. Movement’s weird, smokes still behave like living organisms, but then you hit that one perfect headshot and everything clicks. The dopamine hits, the addiction resets, and suddenly it’s the best game ever again. CS2 right now is gambling, art, and misery stitched together by nostalgia. It’s broken, beautiful, and completely unstoppable. 10/10, pure ecstasy and suffering in perfect balance.",1064,173,0.0178571428571428,0.0281954887218045,0,0,0,1,0,0.2012987012987012,0.590213358070501,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,3,1,2,104,2004.5666666666664,24.616666666666667,2005.3,0,1,0,0,0.5307880339890584,0.0122758024568227,0,19.28173076923077,0.0192307692307692,1,1762187044,1762187044,0,1,0,0,3,0,766,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,2102567,327398,8,Very Positive,2102567,327398

The player base is mostly cheaters and smurf/fake accounts. Whenever you hop in a Premier match, you're guaranteed 1 grifter and 1 cheater per game, on average.

I played for around 500 hours at this point and I've reached ~~12K premier rating, which I feel is not a lot. I would love to continue progressing through, but for some reason at this level the toxicity increases by 500%. More cheaters, more grifters, more racists, more Finish backseaters, more French otakus, it's wild. So many kebab orders, so much russian cussing, so much free and unrequested hate.

If you're a competitive player, and want to improve at a game, don't choose counterstrike. It's not rewarding.

208319145,570,Dota 2,bots,recent_all,"If you are worried about your mental health, I gotta warn ya, dota 2 community is toxic as HELL and Valve made it super easy for these toxic people to report you ""for no reason at all"".. yeah that's right. each player gets to report another, 6 times in each match. and it does not end at this point. admins who ban ya also dont know anything about roles. For example if pick a sup and the carry is too dumb to make the game a win, you CAN NOT act like a boss and stand up for kills. You gotta just move behind the dumbest core ever till enemy finishes the game in 60 mins. That is what this game has transformed to. A pool of toxicity that when you show creativity, they just throw you to LOW priority. NOW, what is low priority you may ask? Its a match unlike what you installed on your computer. in fact you kinda get to play another game. with only 3 heroes. its a game of chances that this toxic community LOOOOOVEEEES. I've been playing since dota 1. so more than your age probably. I recommend that you don't install this game until they fix the Behavior Score policy. it just ruins your day when you are super niceee and super creative and then coming back to your PC to play a game in which you payed $2000 of skins, and NOPE you can not play this game. you gotta play Single draft with the most stupid players on the surface of this planet till you win 5 matches. and you wont win for like 10 or 12 matches which takes 5 days of a normal human with a JOB ^_^ yeahh. Also the ranking system is super stupid. you just cant win a 1 v 9 game when you get the worst team mates who think of nothing but ruining your experience and revenge on ""why did you tell me to buy wards?"". as Gaben said, he does not care about our feedback. He just does what he wants to.",1764,350,0.0300453514739229,0.0192743764172335,0,2,0,1,0,-0.0052445302445302,0.5,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2661.9333333333334,56.38333333333333,2661.9333333333334,0,1,1,1,0.6626762503443612,0.021181346890731,0,2661.9333333333334,1.0,1,1762180971,1762180971,0,0,0,0,3,0,884,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,715110,94375,8,Very Positive,715110,94375

208099986,570,Dota 2,bots,recent_all,"I learned to love Dota 2 by playing support at 2 AM, buying wards I swore I couldn’t afford, and watching a hopeless lane become winnable because the map finally made sense. This game is a long conversation with your past self. Yesterday you overextended for one more range creep. Today you drag the wave, plant a sentry on instinct, and live to tell the story.

The magic is how cause and effect stay visible. Win a fight near an objective and the whole river tilts in your favor. Lose a fight with buybacks down and you can feel the punishment in your bones. Patches change the surface, but the logic underneath remains readable. If you pay attention, Dota forgives slower than most games, and teaches faster than you expect.

People joke that nothing feels better than a rampage, but my favorite moments are quieter. A smoke that threads the needle between two wards. A carry who trusts a risky call because you pinged it with confidence. A glimpse of a courier path that gives away an ancient stack. These are tiny, human victories that never show up on the scoreboard and somehow matter most.

If you are new, you do not need encyclopedic knowledge. Learn why vision wins fights. Learn that it is okay to trade farm for tempo. Mute early when needed and keep the chat wheel for jokes, not judgment. Pick two or three heroes that make you curious and keep them until your hands know the buttons before your brain does. There is a day when you stop panicking at the minimap and start reading it. That day changes everything.

To the folks at Valve, thank you for making a competitive game that still feels handcrafted. The silhouettes remain readable, the replays are a gift, and the client gets out of the way when it matters. If I could ask for anything, it would be richer first hour guidance and more guardrails around early social friction. The moment someone feels their first real swing of agency, they stay.

I recommend Dota 2 because it stays interesting in the small details long after the big ones are familiar. It is stubborn, brilliant, occasionally infuriating, and somehow the perfect place to spend a late night with four names you may never meet and a plan that might actually work. See you on the high ground.",2231,397,0.0165844912595248,0.0210667861945316,0,0,0,6,0,0.1717559314070942,0.4659907211651399,1,13,0,0,1.0,13,0,1,0,1,5,5.166666666666667,0.0,5.166666666666667,0,1,0,0,431.8064516129032,0.0,0,1.0333333333333334,0.2,0,1761967264,1761967264,0,0,0,0,2,0,881,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,715110,94375,8,Very Positive,715110,94375

208296666,1172470,Apex Legends,bots|paid,recent_all,"Lets talk about apex legends....  This game launched back in February of 2019, and man oh man it was a hit. That being said Respawn did everything in their power to destroy it so lets talk about it.

1. The movement.....
I'm not normally a huge fan of the extreme fast paced movement but Titanfall had it perfect and when Apex Legends came out they nailed perfectly. It felt fun and exciting but now, not so much chief.
You see I'm not sure why they did it but they went and made Apex Legends, Chunky Legends. I'm not sure if this was a community complaint or or a ranked complaint or even Respawn just sippin the juice too hard but this feels horrible now. It just kills the parkour and sprint feature, I shouldn't have to slide down a hill for a boost in speed. 

2. The guns.....
Respawn did this really cool thing where they brought all the guns from Titanfall and just molested them.
You see they went and looked into the fan favorite weapons and nerfed the life out of them to switch up the meta, but the weapons were fine! Honestly this wouldn't be a bad thing if they buffed them after a while but that's just it, they never get buffed back! Every gun feels like a I'm hitting them with with pillows. You're forced to just puke all your ammo out on one guy because every time you do damage he just runs away and shields back up and rinse and repeat until one of you either runs out of shields or ammo. You make a competitive game and then try to hard to make it  ""player friendly"" and just turned it into a bullet hose arena

3.The characters.
(this one is my personal opinion so feel free to blow past this one) There are so many characters and they cost an arm and a leg to unlock. Half of them are absolutely useless and feel like gimics. The skins are kinda cringe too at times, not all of them but most of them.

4.The Store...
I know the game is free and the store is where they make money but the prices on the items, oh my god.
like 20+ dollars for a majority of the items in the store. It just feels scummy and it's giving wallet reaching big time. Respawn is just becoming activision 2.0.

I think that wraps it up for me. This game used to be such a gem but like all things on earth, aging kills (unless your a lobster) It does feel sad though because this game really speed ran the whole ""killing my own community"" strat within a year I would say. They already announced that there wasn't gonna be a Titanfall 3 so this was the only brainchild in the works to my knowledge which just feels like the thing they care about is collecting card info now and not the Titanfall arena experience this game is built around. Stay away from this game and let it go peacefully into the night.

208225788,1172470,Apex Legends,bots|paid,recent_all,"In the first summer of its launch, the game originally drew me in with its story, characters, and universe. It had a gritty and interesting style of storytelling that eventually got me into Titanfall 2 -- now one of my sci-fi story loves. Unfortunately, my love affair with Apex Legends' storytelling and universe has long since been on the decline ever since they've been whittling down their writing team; most of the narrative/writing direction have now left and gone on to other, better prospects. The love that used to go into the community is now nonexistent compared to the days they had a social media/community manager that EA then fired. A lot of characters now fall into the Overwatch trap of getting released constantly and then receiving zero lore/attention.

In terms of technical stuff, the game was buggy in its initial years of launch, and now is *mostly* stable for most people. Unfortunately, it is not optimised for everyone, and I am in that camp. Most days I'm unable to launch this game without opening it 4-5 times. Getting constant lag warnings (literally all the symbols) in most games and on most days, with fibre internet and an all right PC. 

The biggest joke is that I'm still playing this game, but I like shooting things + I hate change and seeking out new media. For anyone looking into something new to get into for the story and lore and community, honestly, just find a different game.

You can go one single game without playing against people who are the highest rank in the game or ALGS pros. There is not a single reason why someone who has never been above platinum 2 can get into a game with someone who has played in official tournaments. Eventually me and my friend were tired of it and decided to play on alt accounts to hopefully not play against highest rank people, but 3 games in and we were no match for the top 500. I believe this is a result of the poor decisions made by Respawn. They have done nothing but absolutely ruin their game. Marksmen rifles have the highest fastest TTK in the game, the playable character made around movement has the least movement in the game, duos has half the players in it and half the map already covered by zone, and the list goes on. It even got to the point that some pros have quit. The player count is at an all time low for a reason. Today it took me over 8 minutes for me to get into a game, just for it to end in 2 minutes because one of the top 500 players in the world absolutely desecrated me. At this point I cant even accidentally have fun in this game.

Insane microtransaction, a limit to playable characters for absolutely no reason, lack of balance and matchmaking. None of these issues has been fixed since release.

Matchmaking still refuses to function, you sometimes start your match solo with no team and you can't do shit about that, and even when you do get a team, it is so miserable because you have to constantly rely on each other.

The matchmaking is horribly unfair, putting me in lobbies with either people who I wipe out easily or putting me in lobbies with preds that somehow smelled worse than me.
The ranked system also sucks. Placement is waaaay above getting kills, so final zone will tend to have like 10 teams in it all sitting in corners of the zone trying to widdle the other teams down. This made the grind so incredibly boring, and for a game that has such great movement, it's a waste that half the game in ranked is spent standing in a corner.
It also just has the curse of shitty random teammates, so if you REALLY want to download this game in the big 25, get 2 others to play with you.

208016731,1172470,Apex Legends,bots|paid,recent_all,"💥🏃‍♂️ BROOO APEX LEGENDS ITU ROYALE PALING CEPAT, PALING CHAOTIC, DAN PALING STYLISH! 💥

Bayangin lo dilempar ke arena futuristik, 60 orang saling bunuh demi jadi yang terakhir berdiri. Tapi bedanya, ini bukan battle royale biasa, ini parkour, skill, dan teamwork dalam satu paket gila!

⚡ Gameplay? FUSION ANTARA SPEED & STRATEGY!
Lo bisa sliding ngebut di lereng, zipline dari atap ke atap, trus tiba-tiba flank musuh dari arah nggak terduga. Setiap karakter punya skill unik dari healer, trap master, sampe teleport ninja. Lo nggak cuma nembak, tapi juga ngerencanain tiap langkah kayak taktik perang modern.

🔫 Gunplay-nya? CLEAN BANGET.
Recoil-nya terasa realistis, tiap senjata punya feel dan suara khas. Dari Wingman yang satisfying banget pas kena headshot, sampe R-99 yang literally nyemprot peluru kayak air mancur.

🤝 SQUAD PLAY = INTI SEGALANYA.
Main sendiri sih bisa, tapi Apex itu hidup dari kerjasama tim. Lo bakal saling cover, ping lokasi musuh, revive temen di tengah hujan peluru, dan panik bareng pas ring udah nutup. Komunikasi di sini tuh hal paling penting dan paling chaos juga. 😂

🎨 VISUAL & MAP? BERASA FUTURISTIK TAPI HIDUP.
Dari gurun Kings Canyon sampe kota neon di Olympus, semua map-nya detail banget. Warna vibrant, efek ability keren, dan design karakternya bergaya sci-fi yang beda banget dari battle royale lain.

🎵 AUDIO = CLUTCH MOMENT MAKER.
Suara langkah musuh, zipline, atau ultimate Horizon yang mulai aktif, semuanya bisa jadi bedain hidup dan mati. Headset wajib, bro.

🌟 Rating: 9/10
Apex Legends = battle royale buat lo yang suka adrenalin tinggi, teamwork solid, dan gameplay secepat kilat. Gue balik dulu, masih ada squad yang nge-hold high ground. Wish me luck, bro.

This is a unique game, meaning if you are the average cod playing Joe, u won't just be a god here with good aims. The healing system is slower than in cod, so you cant just fully reheal mid fight, here u need to have an edge. Maps are more punishing meaning, there is always cover, but there are massive walls on every map so u need to be careful where u rotate otherwise u are going to be stuck outside. Weapons are solid, not huge recoil, its learnable. Movement is interesting, because at first it feels extremely rigid, then when u learn what to do and how, it can be really fast and fluid. 

What I want to say: this is a skill needed game, I think more than cod. Plus in its current state it is kinda abandoned by devs, but it runs, finds matches fast and that is about enough.",898,175,0.0178173719376391,0.0267260579064587,0,0,0,1,0,0.0659090909090909,0.5128787878787878,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,7,14,30.183333333333334,7.75,35.333333333333336,0,0,0,0,29.75151849806737,0.2193396226415094,0,2.523809523809524,0.5,1,1761830844,1761830844,0,0,0,0,2,0,2458,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,329596,99880,6,Mostly Positive,329596,99880

The teamwork-focused gameplay and constant updates make it incredibly replayable, and Respawn’s attention to detail shines through in every aspect of the game.

However, the experience is sometimes held back by persistent server issues, including lag and connection drops, especially frustrating since there are still no dedicated servers in Africa. Despite these setbacks, Apex Legends remains a thrilling, well-designed shooter that rewards skill, strategy, and communication.

Verdict: A top-tier battle royale with unmatched gameplay — if only the servers could keep up. ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆",762,112,0.0157480314960629,0.0223097112860892,0,0,0,3,4,0.1937499999999999,0.6444444444444445,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,14,7,109.01666666666668,195.21666666666667,195.21666666666667,0,0,0,0,6.9897569179024615,1.0,0,27.88809523809524,2.0,1,1761753375,1761753375,0,0,0,0,2,0,2457,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,,,,0,6,Mostly Positive,329596,99880,6,Mostly Positive,329596,99880

208285658,252490,Rust,bots,recent_all,"I went into Rust thinking I’d build a small base, hunt some animals, and maybe make a few friends. Instead, I learned what true despair feels like.

As a solo, every day is a new horror movie. You spend three hours farming wood, stone, and scrap, finally craft a gun, and then—boom—three guys in matching hoodies and AKs roll up in a minicopter, vaporize you in 0.2 seconds, and then type “ez” in chat.

You finally build a tiny 2x2 base you’re proud of? Congrats! It’ll be offline raided by a 6-man clan before you even wake up. You log back in to a pile of ash and regret.

Rust isn’t a survival game. It’s a suffering simulator disguised as one. The building, the looting, the gunplay—they’re all great. But the balance? Nonexistent. Unless you have a full squad, a sleep schedule that matches the server’s wipe cycle, and nerves of steel, you’re just free loot for bigger groups.

There’s nothing quite like hearing the whir of a minicopter above your head, knowing it’s not Santa—it’s a death squad.

Still, I keep coming back. Why? I have no idea. Maybe I’m just addicted to pain.",1096,195,0.0246350364963503,0.0337591240875912,1,3,0,1,0,0.0098086124401913,0.5686602870813398,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,15,0,31.516666666666666,18.566666666666663,32.68333333333333,0,0,1,0,34.77525118984664,0.568077511473738,0,32.68333333333333,15.0,1,1762136608,1762136608,0,1,0,0,2,0,2527,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,8,Very Positive,517049,81257,8,Very Positive,517049,81257

208096694,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"This game scratches 5 game itches for me. I don't think I've ever had something like this. I love it so much even though it's in early access and has a lot of bugs and glitches. I usually end up hating early access games especially pricey early access games because they don't deliver. They end up getting really popular then what I assume is happening, is they're taking all of the money (because either they want to cash in right away or they're funding another game and not making anymore content even though they promised they would.)

For example, they're planning to make Palfarm. While I'm also excited that they're making Palfarm I hope they continue making content for Palworld and tweaking stuff like:

- The capture rate for example I feel like is ass in the lower levels even if you tweak the settings.

- Flying doesn't feel good. It uses stamina but using a water pal for swimming doesn't use stamina. It doesn't make any sense. Especially since the world is massive. Taking breaks and landing to wait for the flying stamina is crazy.

- The ball mechanic is kinda weird. There is a module that curves when you throw it, it supposedly catches the pals off guard and increases capture power. It does neither and/or there is no difference than just throwing it normally unless you are really good at aiming because the head shot helps capture. I however, suck at aiming especially in fights where I'm kinda fumbling the controls. That is just my skill issue but still.

- I keep getting clipped into the mountains when I'm climbing or fighting pals, especially if they have knock back. I use the rocks to cancel their line of sight but sometimes I'm too late to dodge and it happens.

- The soldiers from the sanctuary chasing you for a long time. Sometimes they disengage but other times they follow you forever and most times, I need to quit the game for them to disengage.

There's so much things to do and I love that it has multiplayer. It runs ok in my potato computer. It's what I wish the pokemon games were like but it's sadly not and not to mention nintendo is super greedy.

I recommend getting it on sale.

Unfortunately for me, however, my enjoyment didn't last. I enter the game, and it runs smoothly until I reach the screen where I customize my character. Before I can start, The game freezes, closes, and the crash reporter pops up.
Please help me. I am excited to play it, but I can't! I know that it is in early access, (And it would make sense to me that being in early access is why it does what it does). I am hoping that I will be able to play it without it crashing by the time it exits early access.
Sorry for going on and on... I don't write steam reviews often.

208011489,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"⭐ Summary:
Pretty solid game overall. It runs fine even on older hardware, but the A.I. pathing and some optimization issues really need fixing.
Still, for an indie dev team, it’s totally worth the price fun, satisfying, and full of potential.

✅ Pros:

-The game’s pretty solid so far.
-Pal designs are kinda mid but still fine a few are actually really cool and memorable.
-The gameplay loop is great: build your base, catch some Pals, and make them work for you super satisfying to watch.
-You can ride them too, which is just pure fun.
-QoL features are surprisingly decent.

❌ Cons:

-The biggest issue right now is the A.I. pathing it’s straight-up terrible, especially around the Oil Rig area.
-Your Pals often get stuck doing nothing, making fights frustrating if you rely on them.

Really hope the devs fix this soon, because the rest of the game is great.

💻 Performance / Optimization:

Optimization is both good and bad. The latest updates made it run fine even on older systems that’s a big plus.

However, on older GPUs like the GTX 1050 2GB, the FPS drops massively when looking toward the middle of the map (the Anubis boss area).

Even with draw distance set to low, frames still tank hard.

It feels like the game forces too much stuff into view distance, which really hurts old hardware.

I wish they’d tweak that I don’t need to see Papalagos Mountain all the way from Faybreak Island anyway 😅

💬 Final Thoughts:
For an indie dev team, they’ve done an awesome job regular free updates, stable performance overall, and lots of potential ahead.
Totally worth the price even at full price, no discount needed. 👍",1661,285,0.0313064419024683,0.0282962071041541,0,0,0,1,7,0.1201388888888888,0.5084050671550671,1,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,1,65,67,77.33333333333333,119.23333333333332,119.23333333333332,0,0,0,0,21.47844827586207,1.0,0,1.7796019900497513,0.9701492537313432,1,1761876231,1761876231,0,1,0,1,0,0,649,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485

207923443,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"I didn’t expect to like Palworld as much as I do, but it really hits that perfect mix of all the games I grew up loving. It has the collecting and raising aspect that reminds me of those old monster companion games, the exploration and discovery of open world adventures, and the strategic battles that scratch the same itch as card and team building games.

What I love most is how everything connects. Building and upgrading my base feels meaningful, not just something you do between missions. My pals actually help out around the place, gathering materials, crafting, and defending it when raids happen. It’s oddly satisfying watching them all work together while I plan out what to build next.

Exploring the world is just as fun. There’s always something new to find, whether it’s a hidden cave, a new type of pal, or a tough fight that forces me to rethink my team setup. It feels like the game constantly rewards curiosity.

It also scratches that collector brain of mine without feeling like a grind. Finding a new pal, learning what they can do, and figuring out where they fit into my setup feels really rewarding. It reminds me of a mix between raising digital monsters, building decks, and running a base all at once.

Palworld just clicks for me in a way few games do. It takes all these mechanics I’ve liked in other games and somehow makes them all work together naturally. I keep telling myself I’ll just log in for a bit to check on my base, and then three hours disappear.",1491,266,0.0147551978537894,0.0201207243460764,0,0,0,5,0,0.0880172694688823,0.4972140762463344,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1,0,7,0,81.51666666666667,84.88333333333334,116.91666666666669,0,0,1,1,18.290738090370063,0.726015680684248,0,116.91666666666669,7.0,1,1761788448,1761788448,0,1,0,1,2,0,648,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485

Palworld feels like a proof of concept of ideas already existing other video games and making them better. I wish I could say more. The soundtrack is monotonous and none of the non player characters feel alive. The gameplay loop is tedious and boring after a few hours with a story that is non existent. I want Palworld to succeed so more developers notice the profitability in this type of game and make better versions. I find Palworld to already be a more enjoyable experience than the latest Pokemon games.

Not suree if this is being worked on. they did add side quest so it is getting better. The Ai needs work you pal would get stuck or just go off somewhere while your being attacked. the humans you fight would also get stuck but it had gotten a lot better and there still fixing things over all is a great game. If you just like bluiding highly recomaned if your looking for more of a stroy its not there at lest yet. overall coming from someone who loves a story i give it a 7/10 its still very fun to play and with friends way better. if they fix thoes things and add a story 10/10 hangs down.,699,140,0.0071530758226037,0.0128755364806866,0,0,0,1,0,0.1882936507936508,0.3962301587301587,1,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,1,1,2,0,391.35,0.0,391.35,0,1,1,1,1.7861249520889229,0.0,0,391.35,2.0,1,1761769893,1761769893,0,1,0,1,3,0,648,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485

i bought it recently cause i was craving a creature collecting game, and all of the recent pokemon games suck ass, i thought why not give it a try
gameplay wise its similar to ark and legends of arceus, which are 2 of my favorite games,
i like a lot of the pals designs, although some of them you can really see the pokemon inspiration xd
combat is fun, travelling the world is fun, the map is MASSIVE. like ive played for 35 hours and i dont even think ive explored half the map, and the biomes ive been to so far are cool with a lot of different pals
the towers are challenging and fun, the base building is also fun

207878367,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"Alright so, this game is definitely better than Pokémon, at least because the last game release is, well, Z-A. Sadly my device can't run the game very well for long periods of time even with my graphic settings bordering potato quality and using extra software to improve performance, but it still was and is very enjoyable to play though the grind did feel kind of extreme at first, that at least until I used certain settings so, maybe it's not that accessible for people without top-quality devices but it certainly let's you define how frustrating gathering resources can be at the more late-ish states of the game.

Gameplay wise it's pretty much what you'd expect, craft'n'gun with a hell of a lot of crafting and raiding, mostly NPCs because I certainly haven't tried playing multiplayer (My PC thanks me for that) yet it can be pretty enjoyable on the lonesome. Not that much story aside of the collectable journals but then again, most people don't even play these capture-and-battle-monsters games for the story. Maybe the worst aspect of the gameplay is that most of the battle progression is just that your items/companions deal more damage and you resist more so there isn't much depth to it, nothing really outstanding for that part aside of the fact most items that actually have a unique aspect to how they work tend to be way more situational.

About the Pals, honestly, I can see the ""plagiarism"" people was crying about for certain designs but then again, I think the ones that should've tried speaking up for that should be Digimon because those are FAR more similar if you ask me. Still, aside of the ""This one looks similar to..."" comment, it feels a little exaggerated.

Palworld might be barely original but honestly, no game currently is and those that actually try a lot to be get either called boring, pretentious or that it's a masterpiece but it's gameplay sucks and you know about what I'm talking about with the last one. Buy it if you like open-world games and the concept of Pokémon, or to make a statement that Nintendo will never even bother thinking of bringing up.

207867271,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"If the Minecraft Pokemon mod, Unturned, Monster Hunter and FORTNITE had a baby. 

This game offers insane amounts of content, backed by infinite amounts of grinding, so despite the game technically not having an end goal, you really can't stop playing it because the game doesn't give you everything it has to offer right away. You only find out as you explore, making you even more excited to play. 
There's 1 open world which seems massive (I haven't explored it fully yet), stacked with ""Pals"" (cute Pokemon ahh creatures that you can butcher with a meat cleaver btw), countless resources, boss dungeons filled with loot, beautiful landscapes, secrets, collectibles and more. If you're lucky, you might even encounter a shiny Pal, just like in Pokemon games. Although they seem much more rare here.
I previously mentioned the game not having an end goal, but it applies in the traditional sense only (no ender dragon type final boss you're preparing for), instead you have personal missions to catch a certain amount of Pok- Pals, craft certain items, and early in the game you're introduced to some high level bosses you can't tackle just yet, which is a good psychological tactic to give the player some goal right away - to catch that high level, boss Pal. But then as you play, you find many more and you're stuck in an endless loop of finding things you want but can't have just yet, making you play more & more.

You are also introduced into a deep, complex, yet addictive base building system that contains separate missions, ways of enslaving your Pals to work on the base, gather supplies, and overall make your virtual home a very lively experience. Ranking up your base feels rewarding, because you know you worked for everything you get (Pals that work day and night don't get credit cause fu*k 'em).

❗The game still being in early access does come with certain flaws, such as bugs and some gameplay mechanics that can definitely be improved. I will name a few.
-if you summoned your Pal to fight someone, and there's an object in between (even a tree), sometimes the Pal will keep throwing its moves at the object, until either the enemy or your pal moves to a side where they can hit each other. Same applies if you summon a Pal on grounds above or below the enemy, they will just stay confused instead of finding a way to jump down or up to hit the enemy. Your only solution then is to run to a spot where they can fight, risk getting hit by the enemy, then re-summon your Pal.
-if you attack those positive vibes NPCs, you should just restart the game. At that point, you become *wanted* like in GTA, and level 40 (which is high) police guys with assault rifles CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. LITERALLY. You can teleport to a different side of the map, they will spawn near you and gun you down. You can climb a f**ing mountain, they will spawn on top waiting to gun you down. You can only get lucky escaping them by doing God knows what, or just restarting your session. I'm all for a difficult experience escaping, but make it a little bit more realistic ffs.
-if you make your character to be obese, cosmetics will glitch out making you look like you don't have an arm and more. You can also roll into a piece of rock sometimes and glitch into the wall requiring you to roll back out for 2 minutes. 

❗Important: many people, including myself, complain that catching a Pal feels less personal when you play online, because if you employ that Pal to the base, players in your guild can literally just steal it and put it in their box, and you can't do anything about it. You obviously guard yourself from this by playing with people you trust, but the game should still write somewhere which player caught a specific Pal, because sometimes you forget which Pal in the base is yours, and which one ""belongs"" to your guild members. 

A solution for this would be making a 3rd section where guild members can ""unassign"" your Pals and put in, but not steal, and only the player that caught it can take it back. The username of the player that caught each Pal should also be written on the Pal description so there are no confusions. 
On top of this, introducing a proper trading system would be required for this to work. I am hopeful that the developers will eventually fix this.

This game has insane amounts of potential and I am definitely excited for future updates and expansions, hopefully they also introduce a completely new map instead of just expanding the main one. 

I strongly recommend this game if you want something that will not get boring at all, to enjoy with friends or by yourself.

207844530,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"Honestly, Palworld surprised me in the best way. Catching Pals, fighting bosses, exploring different biomes, and riding around on mounts. It’s just fun. The mix of survival, base building (with good decorative options to make it your own), and creature collecting works way better than I thought it would.

Every time I think I’ve seen it all, I find a new Pal or a cool area to explore. The world feels alive, and it’s super easy to lose hours just building, fighting, or cruising around on my favorite mount.

If you enjoy games like Pokémon or even Minecraft in the building and exploration aspect, but want something fresh (and kinda hilarious at times), give this a go. Totally worth it.

Even with that in mind, this was almost immediately a pleasant surprise to play despite my expectations of it being a tonal whiplash simulator. Base-building and management is fun, combat is enjoyable, and there's plenty of world to explore too. Despite the somewhat slow overall pace and rough edges of early access, the world settings are entirely customizable which can ease woes in the meantime. I'd say it's worth a shot!

207757276,1623730,Palworld,paid|bots,recent_all,"My first gaming console was a SNES at the age of 3 going on 4. Growing up in a very bad household where I was forced into a car for a couple years of my life and losing my summer breaks with other kids, I played Pokemon Yellow and Gold on the Gameboy pocket in silence while my step dad drove for 10-16 hours each day around southern Texas... So, believe me, I was a huge fan of Pokemon. Loved Rare with Donkey Kong, StarFox, and Banjo Kazooie. I loved Kirby a LOT and still do.

This is coming from a former dye hard Nintendo Soyjack. Even someone who felt the burn of Creativerse being dumped for Palworld...
This game is worth your time and money.
I love that it's more focused on breeding and actually catching them all. That you aren't limited in customization for Pal's or for bases, something I wish Pokemon Emerald kept in newer versions of the series.
And listen... If you still love Nintendo, you even love the new Pokemon ZA, if it means anything to you, I played Pokemon Snap when BlockBuster offered the kiosks to print off stickers of the high scores I made. I even played Pokemon Stadium with the GB controller pak attachment for Gold/Silver and yes I got the Snorlax beanbag chair from it and was blown away by something not many people knew about, at least during the time the internet was JUST starting to include gaming guides for popular releases in a text file.

I ran through the Safari zones to get the rare Chansey's to breed, I revived the fossils on Cinnabar Island, I caught the Ho-oh, Mewtwo, and one of the three legendary Janto defenders. So, I can tell you from someone who used to treasure those moments, Palworld has recaptured that feeling I used to get playing Yellow, Gold, and Emerald. It feels like a true spiritual successor, regardless of Nintendo stating otherwise with their disgusting recent actions. No, I'm not just talking about the stupid patent war or them suing Palworld. I think the most absurd thing Nintendo has done recently is, in fact, the new Pokemon ZA... It feels like such a slap in the face to Nintendo fans when Palworld CONTROLS better than.
I felt the same way I did when I got that Snorlex decoration or printing out Pokemon Snap stickers when Terraria did a collab with Palworld. I got excited like when I started a base in Emerald when the new Farming Sim was announced (and I will be buying it because I am also a somewhat fan of Animal Crossing).

If you are a Pokemon fan, I am telling you, from a fan of the series before the Switch 2 came out, before a key member of Nintendo died (Rest his soul, iykyk), you will love Palworld, even with the bugs... which as someone who played a lot of the three Pokemon titles mentioned had more than it's far share of bugs, as well, with no way to patch it. It's got everything I wish Scarlet had when I saw playthroughs (because I was broke at the time when it released). It's a good paced game that heavily rewards if you breed and hatch eggs to gain better traits, merge bad traits with a favorite Pal to raise their rank, and/or fill the compendium, or if you complete higher level dungeons.

My score is Lamball out of Pikachu following you in Pokemon Yellow (so like a 11 out of 10). I highly recommend this soon to be classic.",3253,599,0.0439594220719336,0.0215185982170304,0,0,0,1,0,0.083158398978071,0.5294233908168334,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,71,0,79.58333333333333,17.85,90.61666666666666,0,0,1,0,40.87539267015707,0.1969836306786831,0,90.61666666666666,71.0,1,1761612995,1761612995,0,1,0,1,3,0,646,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,155212,7485

There's a lot of content that you can progress through, and there's a lot of ways to optimize things, which is the really fun part for me. Trying to figure out how to build in a way that you get around the basic structure of the game keeps me interested. Is there a better option, is there another way, what else could I do, what am I missing? All of this stuff keeps your attention, and the greatest part is that when you find something, the Devs don't try to restrict you and force you into playing only the way that they want, the way that all of the other games do that kill them. They're games, they're supposed to be fun. I currently have a 6 wall high base, 2 levels that are 3 high each, there's 9 beds stacked on top of each other and 6 of those stacks, breaking the mechanics of the game for increased optimization, and I have 4 ranches stacked on top of each other with a bunch of Pals crowded around the first level pumping out resources. If I get annoyed with something, like a giant Pal who takes up too much space in the base just because they have the best starting skill level, there are ways to investigate and solve that issue by getting the smallest Pal in the entire game, with the lowest starting skill possible, and growing them to be even better than the basic level that the larger Pal started at.

Insane prices for store items of ever decreasing quality.
Low effort Battle passes you can only finish if you take up playing Call of Duty as your second job.
Constant upselling at every opportunity, even in your 70 Euros premium title.

(Rating: 10/10 for ""one more game"" addiction, 0/10 for Ricochet anti-cheat, ∞/10 for ""EZ noob uninstall"" therapy)
Day 1: Hype Train Derails (2023 Launch)
Drop $70 on ""full game."" Campaign? 5 hours of Warzone reskins—feels like DLC for MW2. Multiplayer? Queue up, get matched with gods. Teammate 1: Octane wannabe slides off cliff. Teammate 2: Crypto drones himself. Me? P2020 spray-n-pray into a wall. Then cheater walls us with aimbot. ""Welcome to MW3, paypig!""
Day 500: SBMM Says ""Git Gud"" (2024)
Hit Gold! Buy $20 bundle for that ""meta"" skin. Ranked? SBMM yeets me into Pred lobbies. Ping spikes to 200ms on Tokyo servers. Bullets? Ghost through enemies. Enemy: Cronus Zen kid with zero recoil beams me through smoke. Report? ""Action taken"" on my shadowban. Back to 150ms cheater lobbies.
Day 2000: Review Bomb Apocalypse (2025)
Grind battle pass for epic flatline blueprint. Activision: ""Two passes/season, $20 each!"" Steam goes Mostly Negative—""$70 DLC scam!"" I uninstall... reinstall for Warzone integration. Cheaters? Banned 65k, but new ones spawn like zombies. Ricochet: ""99% cheater-free!"" Me: ""In what universe?""
Day 3500: Cheater Chronicles Reloaded
Pred? Nah, Iridescent full of spinbots. Console ""safe""? Cronus/XIM mag-dumps. PC? Wallhacks every 2/3 games. Watch death cam: Enemy snaps 180° through walls. Anti-cheat waves? Cheaters laugh, buy new accounts. I report 50, get ""false positive"" shadowban. Playing with bots now—literal ones.
Day 5000: Operator Overload
Main Ghost—OP! Nerf. Switch Soap—slide cancel queen! Nerf. Every gun: Buff week 1, trash week 2. Perks? Spam the meta 3. Spawns? Behind you, always. ""Open Beta no SBMM"" lied—full release is sweat factory. Every legend balanced like my K/D: 0.8 forever.
Sound & Graphics: Boom... Then Crash (Until Packet Loss)
Gunshots? Crisp pew-pew. Explosions? Hollywood BOOM. Then smoke—white void hell. Footsteps? Hear from orbit, yours? Muted. Controller vibrates mid-clutch... disconnects. ""FUUUUUUUUCK MY LOADOUT!"" Neighbors: ""SWAT or COD?""
Community: Toxic Family Reunion

Russian: ""CYKA SLIDE BLYAT"" (dies first).
Solo savior: ""Ping rez"" (ghosts).
Me: ""Group?"" → Mute + ""FEEDER NOOB.""
Streamers: Hacked, DDOS'd. Pros: ""Cheaters ruined ranked.""

Optimization: Activision's Prank DLC
FPS: 300 firing range → 40 in TDM. Ping: 20 solo → 180 crossplay. Crashes: Mid-1v3 ace. Hitreg: Bullets teleport. ""Server issues!"" Every patch: 100GB download for ""bug fixes"" that add more bugs.
Conclusion: Why I Haven't Quit (Send Help)
MW3 isn't a game—it's a masochist simulator. Every loss: ""Skill issue/SBMM/cheater?"" Every win: God mode (rare). Spent $500 on bundles invisible in shadowban. Cheaters banned? Respawn tomorrow. But that one 20-kill game... pure crack.
Recommend if:

You love screaming at Cronus kids.
Training patience for 200ms peeks.
Broke but flex $1000 tracer packs.

Silver 4 Pro Tip:
""Teammate calls bot? 'At least I don't Cronus—your aim's Ricochet-free!' Roasted.""

The game is a laggy mess and the players are the biggest try hards ever. Not an ounce of casual enjoyment. Just terrible. The definition of an addictive video game. Just constant loss to infuriate and pull you back in. I wish this game didnt exist and activision would go back to making actually fun games. I wish I could get the hour of my life back that it took to install this trash. Absolutely 100% zero enjoyment. I hate this game with every fiber of my being.

First of all when i downloaded the game i needed to update the game again, which is fine. But when i finally was able to play the game I came to the conclusion that the multiplayer side of this game is completely brain dead and is not fun to play. Activision purely focusses on getting as much money as they can while giving their player base a whack ass game.

The zombies gamemode was fine but nothing special, i can also play bo3 which is a way better game in my opinion.
Overall i would not recommend this game.",586,113,0.0119453924914675,0.0136518771331058,0,0,0,2,0,-0.027056277056277,0.4695346320346321,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,16,84,0.7333333333333333,0.5833333333333334,0.75,0,0,0,0,799.0909090909091,0.7777777777777778,1,0.0089285714285714,0.1904761904761904,0,1762132486,1762132486,0,0,0,0,4,0,1099,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,,,,0,5,Mixed,216478,147986,5,Mixed,216478,147986

Every time I just want to relax and play Warzone, I’m hit with the same “TRAVIS - RILEA” connection failed error. It’s frustrating that players have to constantly deal with login timeouts and server issues while there’s barely any proper communication or fix from the devs.

The game itself is great when it works — but the backend reliability and support are just unacceptable now. For a title backed by such a big studio, players deserve stable servers and timely updates. Please, Activision, focus on fixing your infrastructure before adding more content.",613,99,0.0358890701468189,0.0163132137030995,0,0,0,1,0,-0.0583333333333333,0.4048611111111111,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,8,170,19.866666666666667,1.2166666666666666,20.95,0,0,0,0,30.85570469798657,0.0580747812251392,0,0.123235294117647,0.0470588235294117,0,1762073038,1762073038,0,1,0,0,1,0,1098,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,5,Mixed,216478,147986,5,Mixed,216478,147986

the last CoD i played was BO2, and loved every bit of it till the hacks, and cheats got to a point where i couldnt stand it anymore. 

i returned to to CoD with MW3, and heavily enjoyed it, and thought they improved their anti cheat.

then came BO6, which i preordered with high hopes, only to be let down. 

people dont even attempt to try to hide they are cheating. 

as a OG from xbox, xbox 360, to PC, the developers let us down. 

its sad to see CoD, and CS:GO be rewarded to the same group of people.

Every year they release a brand new game. but then on top of that over they've also really gone super hard on stuffing skins and battle passes down our throats. I think it'd be forgivable if they were at least dropping without game breaking bugs. 
where are the millions of dollars going?! like at least use some of it to fix the flippin game right? I'm glad Battlefield is making a come back.

207976076,1938090,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,bombing|paid,recent_all,"I across ps4 and pc I probably have 200 hours in this game. I am only leaving this review in the hopes that the big wigs running cod see this. The game used to be fun, I used to buy every title. I will never ever ever give any cod title my money ever again. I played COUNTLESS hours of warzone, mw,  mwII, mwIII, and the newer black ops. Nothing new is ever added into the game. It always feels like they use nostalgia in order to sell new titles NOT new features or better gameplay. I tried to come back to warzone and BO6 one last time before I leave the franchise forever but I simply cannot bring myself to play these games anymore. The original MW2 made me fall in love with video games, the state of cod right now makes me ashamed to know ive ever spent anytime playing these titles. Save your money, save your time. At this point ever since redsec dropped for battlefield I uninstalled warzone quick as heck. Every conversion kit and ""meta"" weapon build is cringe i hate everything about this game. It will never be warzone during early covid and ill remember that time fondly. 

TLDR: Do yourself a favor. Delete the game. Play battlefield 6. Stop giving this greedy scummy company your money.

208309771,271590,Grand Theft Auto V,bombing,recent_all,"LIke everyone else, I grew up playing Grand Theft Auto.

I do love them but I lost access to my old email that was unfortunately used for my Rockstar Games account and now I cannot boot this or any other Rockstar game using their 3rd party launcher (Red Dead, GTA IV, likely GTA VI).

Rockstar support seems to be a team of bots, sending me the exact same copy-pasted message with a different agent in the signature. Despite attaching proof, they just automatically close my ticket and I cannot reply, saying ""We investigated"" and now I can't access games I've spent hundreds of dollars on, and saves I've spend hundreds of hours on. They can't just unlink my Steam account from my Rockstar Games account, instead I can never play something made by them again as long as it uses their 3rd party launcher.

If the actions of this company past and present have proven one thing its that they just want you to buy their game as many times as possible.

The visuals are cleaner, performance is smoother, and the city feels more alive than ever. Driving, shooting, and just messing around in Los Santos still hit hard after all these years.

It’s not a brand-new experience, but it’s the best version of a classic — a proper tribute to a game that defined a whole generation.

What starts as a simple farming sim turns into a peaceful life adventure — farming, fishing, mining, making friends, even finding love. Every in-game day feels rewarding, and there’s always something new to discover.

The music is relaxing, the art is charming, and the community of Pelican Town somehow feels real. Whether you play for 10 hours or 200, it never loses its magic.

💛 Perfect for winding down, escaping reality, or just living your best pixelated farm life.

Stardew Valley is honestly the best game for anyone who just wants to relax and discover new things at their own pace. Every playthrough feels different. I’m still learning new stuff every time I play, even after hours in the game. It’s cozy, peaceful, and somehow never gets old.

For something made by one person, it’s insanely impressive. ConcernedApe built a whole world that just pulls you in, from the farming and fishing to the characters and the music.

207979169,413150,Stardew Valley,normal,recent_all,"This game is absolutely amazing, specially having in mind that it was originally made by Concerned Ape instead of a huge company. 

The story itself isn't quite amusing, but the whole game has an energy that simply just drags you in. The whole concept of inheriting a farm in the middle of nowhere and deciding to go there moved by the feeling of emptyness in your life is already calling. Also, I love the friendship mechanics and the fact that you can marry the bachellors; although some 14 heart events are boring. Besides, some festivities or special events (like Christmas and The Egg Hunt) are really exciting because they are more interactive. I would like The Egg Hunt more if the locations of the eggs changed every year though.

However, I must say that the game gets kind of repetitive if you're playing alone. I highly recomend you to play online, it's more thrilling and you can't predict what will happen through the day. Also, the skull caverns are kind of boring (in my opinion), and for others is the thing they hate the most about the game.",1062,188,0.0188323917137476,0.0169491525423728,0,0,0,1,0,0.1017602040816326,0.6192857142857143,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1,0,1,0,74.06666666666666,5.1,76.93333333333334,0,1,1,1,14.33843384338434,0.0662911611785095,0,76.93333333333334,1.0,1,1761847845,1761847845,0,1,0,0,3,0,999,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,429755,5008,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,429755,5008

207951672,1145360,Hades,normal,recent_all,"The first Hades was, no doubt in my mind, leagues ahead of Hades 2. Don’t get me wrong. Hades 2 is still good, but those 94 critic scores on Metacritic and OpenCritic feel a little high. I’d call it a solid 84 to 87.

The original Hades? That’s Mount Rushmore of PC gaming territory. Mid to high 90s, no question.

I like games that feel good for the soul and Hades did that in every way. The lore, story, and gameplay hooked me for hundreds of hours. A huge difference is The Infernal Arms were more fun and iconic than Melinoë’s options, with a heaviness to the hits. Playing as Zagreus put me in a full flow state.

I wanted to read every single line in Hades 1. Not so much in 2. I loved Persephone’s story. Finally finding her and getting to visit her those ten times before bringing her back was the perfect payoff.

The writing had a pulse and i could see myself in multiple characters. Even you Hades. You understand him by the end. And dare i say feel bad beating him. 

And the soundtrack. I usually just enjoy music in games enough, but this one stuck. I added extra playtime just to listen to “Good Riddance” and “On the Coast.” So if its on the metacritic scale i give it a 96. The third highest rated PC game of all time. I liked it so much I am going to now buy Super Giant's other games. I have the most hours played on Hades of all my PC games. It even has a doggy you can pet which makes it that much better!",1426,278,0.0406732117812061,0.0245441795231416,1,1,0,6,0,0.1951190476190476,0.4752960102960102,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,1,0,2,0,280.3833333333333,0.0,280.3833333333333,0,1,1,1,5.085894311359448,0.0,0,280.3833333333333,2.0,1,1761826184,1761826184,0,1,0,0,3,0,999,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197

The only part I really dislike is having to pursue the Olympians to unlock their hearts. God, it’s so painful. I was completely exhausted after doing 50–60 runs just waiting for that one blasted dialogue to finally appear. That part feels super frustrating.
And yeah, the game is tough. Once you hit 25+ Heat, things get insane—especially with Extreme Measures stacked on top. Hades himself just goes completely wild at that point.
At the end of the day though, it’s a fun game wrapped in a whole lot of pain.

207941166,1145360,Hades,normal,recent_all,"Hades is hands down the best roguelite I’ve ever played. Every single run feels rewarding — whether you win or lose, you’re always making progress. The combat is smooth and satisfying, the soundtrack absolutely bangs, and the art direction is top-tier.

What really sets it apart, though, is the storytelling — it’s genuinely interesting, something I didn’t expect from a roguelite. Characters evolve naturally over dozens of runs, and it never feels repetitive.

It took me around 75 hours to 100% the game, and even then, I wasn’t bored for a moment. The gameplay loop is addictive, the writing is clever, and the challenge scales perfectly as you grow stronger.

If it’s on sale, it’s a must-buy — but even at full price, you can’t go wrong.

This game has some of the smoothest movement and combat, as well as some of the best in-depth interactions in a video game. The fact that the story line and narrative is so deep that even after 100+ runs there is additional dialogue to learn about every character and their relationship to Zagreus and each other is amazing.

You're doing yourself a disservice if you have not tried this game.

207871544,1145360,Hades,normal,recent_all,"very nice quality and amount of detail.  Game seems very refined  and thought-out.

my main issue is the lack of complexity with how different systems and mechanics interact  with each other. Also for my taste is too anti-chaotic for roguelike and instead focus on builds, which makes some of the item choices just redundant  and doesn't award experimentation much.

Overall grade : 9/10

I purchased this game on sale due to the hype about the release of the second one. It is a roguelike in which you play as the son of the god of the dead trying to escape his father's realm facing hordes of enemies and collecting ""boon"" power-ups from the gods of Olympus to become more powerful. 

PROS: 
- Progression: The game has an amazing progression system that makes it so every run you unlock something new. It might be small or big but it still helps overall. Every run I would go a bit further and became a bit stronger. Even after you beat the game once you get a new ""endless"" progression system where you can get more rewards by making the run harder. 
- Dialogue and NPCs: The game feels like it has endless dialogue with it's array of fun and plentiful characters. They will either say the next line that's queued up or, more likely, comment on something you have done. Even in the hub there was always someone to talk to and some quest to progress. For a game like this where you essentially do the same thing over and over this was great to see. 
- Quests and Collectables: During my runs I always made it a priority to do the quests or collect resources that helped me upgrade my hub. It kept me busy and entertained, no need to say more. 
- Boons and Weapons: The boon powers you get from the gods are all fun and different, and you have a tone of ways to combine them and even together with the many weapons to create very powerful and fun builds. You can also use some items and talents to affect these boons so there are many layers of options. That being said, I didn't enjoy using all of the weapons but opinions online vary. 

CONS: 
- Lack of level and enemy variety: The game focuses on quality over quantity. And it is filled to the brim with content for sure. However if you will excuse the spoiler, the game has only a few levels and just as many bosses. Sure all of them (except for 1 very boring boss) change depending on your actions and progression, but compared to other roguelikes that have several times that number of levels it can feel a bit predictable after 10-20 runs. The mobs are also mostly the same every playthrough so you will focus on beating them as fast as possible to get to the next reward and dopamine hit. 
- Strong presence of ""woke"" political ideals: The game features the ancient Greek pantheon and mythology. And yet many of the characters are featured having skin shades a lot darker than they should be. There are also many LQBT themes and characters. The game also beats you over the head with the importance of consent, even for some very trivial things.  That being said it's not as bad as some other games, which is reflected in it's overwhelmingly positive grade, but I know there are those among you who don't tolerate any of this so I felt it needed to be pointed out. 

Overall I recommend this game, it gave me about 100 hours of fun, quick action and it's worth the price tag. Even better, it's often on sale.",3017,562,0.0198873052701358,0.0162412993039443,0,0,0,5,0,0.0734009009009008,0.4298286923286923,1,1,1,0,0.5,2,0,1,0,9,0,92.33333333333331,31.5,92.33333333333331,0,0,1,1,32.675090252707584,0.3411552346570397,0,92.33333333333331,9.0,1,1761606479,1761606479,0,1,0,0,1,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197

207720145,1145360,Hades,normal,recent_all,"its okay. really overhyped. i really like the dialogue stuff because its quite high effort and unique, i am really into greek lore, i love how the hubs design improves, but the gameplay is just not really all that great. even though there is always new dialogue, it gets quite stale, e.g. talking to hypnos and relatively quickly in i just dont feel like listening / reading through it all. even the reward of getting to mother doesnt really satisfy me after like the fifth time getting. i really dont like purely weapon based gameplay (e.g. hades / dead cells) as opposed to ""ability"" based gameplay (e.g. wizard of legend, astral ascent) or weapon kits where i have >4 options (e.g. enter the gungeon, binding of isaac), so for me weapons that arent my favourite get very stale quickly in hades specifically. on the topic of weapons, i havent unlocked aspects or other heat related stuff yet, but already really dislike half the weapons and enjoy the other half, meh... in dead cells i enjoy the vast majority of the huge arsenal of weapons and tools, not here sadly. the boons are mostly cool with few exceptions, e.g. ares stacking seems to really suck, athena, zeus, aphro and demeter on the other hand seem crazy broken at times, poseidon is a meme through and through, i SHOULD really love what he does as it encoroporates things i enjoy in games, but i fucking hate using his boons altogether.. they seem great on the surface until you realize how few there really are, it just doesnt feel as unique as playing dead cells or gungeon. and most things are just slight modifiers to how you play anyway, same as many items in gungeon, but at least many guns force different playstyles, e.g. when reloading.

i also really dislike a lot of enemy design, gonna be honest on that one.
e.g. the bone hydra boss when most of em are spamming summons and or fireballs, certain hades summons, anything related to wagons. theseus in his entirety, that fight fucking blows, and most importantly: anything related to butterflies - god the miniboss is so atrociously awful to fight and makes me actually miserable!
this is a huge reason for me not actually continuing, other games like gungeon or wizard of legend have similar challenging or at times annoying enemies, but theyre usually fun or optional to fight. i just cannot ignore how unfun it is fighting chariots and butterflies, elysium in general is a horrendous area and i dread going there every single run..

lookwise i got used to the game and it is quite gorgeous, at least that part of my prejudgemental attitude towards hades did change within my gameplay hours.

overall, i just do not find the combat satisfying or fun enough to wanna continue. unlocks are fun, dialogue etc. is fun, but i dont really care for these nearly enough. the run length is also fine and heat modifiers seem okay enough.

my favourite part was upgrading the lobby and unlocking cool new rooms mid run",2935,516,0.0020442930153321,0.0255536626916524,1,0,0,5,0,0.0834067804854322,0.4821326426382606,0,1,0,0,1.0,1,0,0,0,102,119,30.383333333333333,20.0,30.383333333333333,0,0,0,0,96.5990126165661,0.6582556226001097,0,0.2553221288515406,0.8571428571428571,1,1761575994,1761575994,0,1,0,0,0,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,143872,2197

207615631,1145360,Hades,normal,recent_all,"I rarely write reviews, but Hades absolutely deserves the additional praise. I'm sure it has been said a thousand times already, but if you are here because you checked a box for action roguelike or roguelite you should absolutely check this title out, and if not you should check it out even sooner. There are few games that deliver on that concept as handily as Supergiant's Hades. If you've never played this style of game you're in for a treat. I would 100% recommend this as an entry point into the genre, I envy your opportunity to start here. This belongs in a hall of fame with other champions such as TBOI. If this franchise is not already on every list of the top 10 games in this category I would be shocked. Well done.

Review:
Elegant simplicity of initial game play meets exceptional attention to detail in every aspect and subtle satisfying growth in complexity as the game progresses. 
This game nails every element that keeps you coming back again and again in a great roguelite. 5 years after release and it still stands out. I am confident I will still be revisiting this game for years to come. 
Hades 2 looks just as brilliant and receives glowing reviews as well. That game caught my eye first, and I am extremely happy with my decision to play this one before starting the next installment. It was absolutely worth visiting first, and the main complaint seems to be that Hades 2 did not break the mold cast by Hades enough. I can't wait to check it out, more of the same with a few new tricks and some additional polish based on player feedback sounds perfect to me!
The storytelling is clever, often relying on, but rarely (if ever) suffering from,character exposition. The tale of Prince Zagreus attempting to leave the nest and the story of his motivations comes across in cleverly executed triggered events which mostly take the form of bite-sized often humorous banter between characters. The blending of a few reenactments and witty dialogue in the retelling of what brought the protagonist to his current state really shines. Hades may not hold the number one spot for depth of story in my library, but it hits it out of the park on lore and theme. This game absolutely delivers a solid and engaging story in a clever way. Honestly the polished, exciting, and dynamic game play alone would shine enough to have hidden a lot of sins, but this game has nothing to hide.   10/10 


Note: I'm not an all-in completionist by nature. I usually play games intensely for a moderate duration until something else captures my attention and I move on to the next exciting thing. That said, I am confident that I will be 100%-ing hades at least once, likely again at the 10 year anniversary.

TLDR: Buy this game... You'll wish you had bought it yesterday and downloaded it already...

207907878,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"What I Loved:

---World & Atmosphere
The game’s setting is astonishing. The landscapes—be it the misty isles of Skellige, the grim streets of Novigrad or the war-torn Northern Kingdoms—feel alive, layered and often haunting. The small environmental touches (weather changes, ambient NPC chatter, background threats) make it more immersive than many open worlds. 

---Storytelling & Characters
The main thread and the side quests alike carry weight. You’ll meet characters you care about, face decisions whose consequences ripple—often unpredictably. The writing is solid, mature (though not flawless) and frequently rewards patience. For example: “monsters you are contracted to slay are deeply connected to the lives of the people who hire you.” 

---Quest Quality (Mostly)
Many side quests aren’t just filler—they tell their own tales, develop the world, introduce moral complexity. For RPG-fans who love exploration and story, that’s a big plus. 

---Scale & Value
There’s so much to do. If you’re willing to dive deep, you’ll get dozens of hours of content, and likely feel the game more than “played.” The scope here is impressive.

---If I were to sum it up: The Witcher 3 is exceptional, but not perfect.
For story- and exploration-loving gamers: strongly recommended. You’ll find a world, characters, and quests that stay with you.

For gamers who prioritize tight, mechanical combat, minimal filler, or super-streamlined systems: you might get frustrated with some of the rough edges.

I’d give it something like 4.5/5 (or 9/10) in many cases—meaning: one of the best games of its generation, with meaningful caveats.",1626,251,0.025830258302583,0.025830258302583,0,0,0,8,0,0.1321428571428571,0.5513784461152881,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,2,0,5,18,29.25,0.0,29.25,0,0,0,0,55.58974358974359,0.0,0,1.625,0.2777777777777778,1,1761772707,1761772707,0,1,0,0,1,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811

207747991,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"The game is doing pretty well all things considered that it's 10 years old.
Although there are some problems in the next-gen version because of some issues considering the rendering. So if you're like me and have had problems with the world generation having gaps in it or even holes I believe I can help you. If you have and AMD GPU and are experiencing some world artifacts then listen up.
I don't know who's to blame but I believe it's AMD's fault. As of 29/10/2025 the most recent software update fucked it up so to fix it you'll have to downgrade it to an older version. This is mostly aimed at RX 6000 series, and partially RX 5000 series. 
The graphic drivers from 24.5.1 for 6000 series fixes these world artifacts. And 20.2.2 works fine for 5000 series.

Other than that it's a goated game- and if you like Geralt consider reading the books as well because you will find out that Geralt is not like in the games. Which I found out after I read the first half of the first book.",986,184,0.0314401622718052,0.0162271805273833,0,0,0,2,0,0.0401041666666666,0.4182291666666667,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,39,189,387.4666666666666,71.98333333333333,397.6,0,0,0,0,2.5447350309704064,0.1810446009389671,0,2.103703703703704,0.2063492063492063,1,1761602115,1761695637,1,1,0,0,1,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811

Enemies can kill you quickly, but can be easily dodged and chipped down. Healing is mostly done thru eating food and killing enemies in battle, but you can also make potions that will heal you but toxify your system. Enemy variety is really good. While there are recurring enemy types like wild dogs, wolves, ghouls and drowners, there are rarer enemies that take a lot more effort to kill. I bet I haven't seen even half them. Stronger enemies usually act as boss fights, where you're in an isolated arena and aren't outnumbered (usually). Humans are also enemies. Side quests are really good, whereas in Elder Scrolls there are only a few good ones in IV and V. Randomly stumbling upon a quest marker and it turning into a side quest about a small village all being turned into pigs blew me away.",936,172,0.0181623931623931,0.0213675213675213,0,0,0,1,0,0.1304292929292929,0.4968434343434343,1,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,822,1992,33.03333333333333,0.0,33.03333333333333,0,0,0,0,28.33501513622604,0.0,0,0.0165829986613119,0.4126506024096386,1,1761582257,1761582257,0,1,0,0,1,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811

207662847,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"i hate reddit so much and i hate that they are so right about this game for the past 10 years

goated game if you think its for you then it very likely is, its long tho

and yea blood and wine DLC is genuinely the best and most worth your time and money DLC ever made 

The decision making in the dialogue/quests in the witcher 3 are generally a lot better than in games from bioware, ubisoft and telltale games; i usually feel like in those games every decision i make has some sort of negative outcome or makes another character hate me for seemingly no reason. In the witcher 3 you can pretty much do what you feel is right for your own reasoning, with no clear right or wrong decision, and chances are Geralt will reciprocate that himself in his dialogue; Geralt is a fantastic character for an RPG, as while hes still kind of a ""blank slate"" for the player, he still has morals and a personality, meaning that the choices you make in the game are all things that you can definitely see him choosing himself, ""good"" or ""bad"". this was honestly a huge breath of fresh air for me after being constantly told how stupid i am after every choice in the aforementioned ""RPG""s. 
Sadly i will say that the only time where the whole ""consequences of your actions"" fall apart in this game is quite literally in the most integral parts of the plot, especially in regards to the different endings of the main story and the Blood and Wine DLC, but ill let it off i suppose 

soyeah. play the game it looks good and runs good enall.

theres some cringe card game i keep getting messages about that i need to play but idk what that is, completed everything without playing one round of it so dont worry about that

I ended up playing almost daily and exploring as much of the enormous and beautiful world as my free time permitted. My god, what a trip. The characters are well-written. The bloody baron arc will perhaps stay with me for the rest of my life. The choices feel impactful and Geralt is as cool a cat as they come. If for whatever reason you're doubting whether you should play this... don't. Just do it. Preferably on death march for full immersion once you get the hang of the combat. It will really drive you to become a true witcher and use all tools at your disposal to kick some serious monster but. 10/10 game for sure.

You’ll meet many characters in Witcher 3 who were already part of Witcher 2, and knowing their stories makes your whole experience so much better.

Play it on Death March or at least Blood and Broken Bones difficulty. Playing on easier difficulty makes potions and oils feel kind of useless, and that’s a big part of what makes being a Witcher so cool.

Do as many side quests as you can, seriously, some of them are more memorable, more emotional, and better written than entire main stories in other games.

Don’t get me started on the music.. just experience it yourself

The DLCs are absolute perfection they’re not just add ons, they’re full blown masterpieces that could easily be standalone games.

For me, this game is an easy ∞/10. Absolute masterpiece, everyone should play it at least once.

207525493,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"The Witcher 3, since it came out in 2015, I've heard it mentioned as one of the best games of all time. It's always in the top 5 of any list of favorite video games.

I've always known what the game was about, but it never intrigued me because I grew up playing Skyrim, Dragon Age, and recently Baldur's Gate, etc.

So I've always had a repulsion for these medieval fantasy worlds. In fact, I started The Witcher 3 by doing the first quests, but I was incredibly bored. I remember putting off the first quest after the prologue for months.

So, at a certain point, I forced myself to continue playing the game. Slowly, I managed to make my way through the story, continuing to only do the primary quests. Before finding Ciri, for me, the game was something I had to do because I wanted to understand what was so special about it. After finding Ciri, the game changed. Totally amazing storytelling and story, from there I started playing it for days until I finished the main story.

I have to say that only after finishing the game can I say that it is OBJECTIVELY one of the best ever made. It's like an ancestor of RDR2, a fantasy version. Everything in the game is content, nothing is secondary, nothing is useless, all the quests and all the interactions are written to be enjoyable. I could spend hours listing the game's strengths, but I want to focus on something that really struck me.

I don't know why, but CD Red has churned out incredible DLC for both The Witcher and Cyberpunk. There are DLCs that are as good as the game itself, if not more.

Hearth of Stone is an incredible DLC, and I loved it for the strange sequence of events that then leads you into the story, but above all for the crazy difficulty of the boss fights. Up until that point, the game was so easy, but the Hearth of Stone bosses literally made me sweat. I was there, struggling, and it was obvious they did it on purpose. It's really fun. Blood and Wine, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. I think it captures everything about the game and translates it into additional content. This DLC contains my favorite part of the game, and perhaps one of my all-time favorites: the fairy tale quest. I think I took 200 screenshots just of the landscape of the DLC area.

In conclusion,
the game is objectively one of the best I've ever played. Anyone who considers themselves a gamer should play and finish it. Perhaps it's truly a work of art. I can't wait for the 4th.

207498609,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"[158시간 도전과제 100% 올클리어]

[h1] THE WITCHER [/h1]
플스로 아주 오래전에 엔딩을 보고 PC판으로 정말 오랜만에 다시 플레이했습니다. 어마어마한 플레이 타임을 알기에 선뜻 시작하긴 어려웠지만 역시는 역시네요. 위쳐3는 숫자3이 붙어 있는게 거슬릴 정도로 그냥 THE Wicther 자체가 되어야 맞지 않을까..하는 생각이 들었습니다. 장점만 있는 게임은 아닙니다, 하지만 장점이 너무 많달까. 

이미 엔딩을 본 게임이기에 한 번에 도과 100%를 하려고 처음부터 최고 난이도인 [죽음의 행진] 난이도로 진행했습니다. 실패한 2개 퀘스트 제외하고 모든 사이드 퀘스트를 다 했고, 지도에 있는 대부분 물음표 마크는 대부분 공략했습니다 (스켈리가는 아직도 몇 개 남았는데 이건 좀..) 

[서사와 선택으로 생동감을 불어넣은 중세 판타지 월드]
작가들이 열일했다.. 라는 생각이 듭니다. 사실 맵 크기로 보면 어쎄신 크리드 시리즈도 어디가서 꿀리지 않습니다. 그런데 두 시리즈에서 느끼는 생동감의 차이는 대체 뭘까요. 바로 캐릭터들의 [서사]라고 할 수 있습니다. 사이드 퀘스트에도 상당한 분량을 할애해서 수많은 사이드 퀘스트에 흥미로운 이야기를 집어 넣었습니다. 거기에 유저들에게 일정 [선택]을 부여했구요. 예를 들어, 길가다가 만난 사이드 퀘스트인데 숫가락을 모으는 저주 받은 괴물을 만나 그냥 죽일 수도 있고 상당히 번거로운 길을 돌아 저주를 풀어줄 수도 있습니다. 훗날 이 괴물은 저주가 풀려 위쳐 집에서 요리사로 일하게 됩니다. 이 정도 분량을 가진 퀘스트라면 다른 게임에서 어떻게든 메인 스트리와 연계해서 보여주려고 노력할텐데 위쳐3에서는 그냥 길 가다가 만난 사이드 퀘스트 중의 하나입니다. 그렇기 떄문에 더 세계를 탐험하고 싶다는 욕구를 들게 만드는거구요. 돌아다니다보면 어떤 흥미로운 일을 만날지 모르니까요. 

이 [선택]은 메인 퀘스트에도 빛이 납니다. 다양한 분기점을 집어 넣어서 유저의 선택에 따라 각기 다른 엔딩과 컷신을 볼 수 있어 게임을 클리어하고 나서도 다시 플레이하게 만드는 동기가 충분했습니다.  

[위쳐는 바람둥이야 H씬] 
애들은 가라! 예니퍼라는 정실?이 있음에도 게롤트는 다양한 인물들과 사랑을 나눌 수 있습니다. H씬이 정말 야한 것도 아닌데 뭔가 유저들을 집중하게 만드는 매력이 있달까. 딱 그 선을 잘 지킨 것 같슴다. 다다익선(?)이라고 최대한 많은 씬을 보면서 흐믓해하고 있는 자신을 보고 있자면 이 게임의 매력의 하나인건 분명하네요. 개인적으로 예니퍼는 너무 까칠하고 되려 트리스 성격이 마음에 들었는데 캐릭터 모델링도 그렇고 메인 스토리 따라가다보니 예니퍼로 돌아섰네요 ㅠ (여기엔 유니콘이 컸다..)  

세상 모든 게임에는 장단점이 있습니다. 위쳐와 같은 게임을 안 좋아할만한 분들도 분명히 있다고 생각해요. 

[상대적으로 어색한 모션]
확실히 연식이 있는 게임이라고 느끼는게 최근 나온 게임들과 비교하면 움직임이 아주 매끄럽지가 않습니다. 뭐 몰입을 방해할 정도는 아니고 익숙해지면 또 괜찮습니다만. 특정 벽이나 구간에서 끼어서 움직이지 못하는 경우가 가끔 있다는 거. 

[텍스트의 홍수]
위쳐3는 기본적으로 서사(이야기)를 통해서 유저의 흥미를 이끌어내는 방식을 취하기 때문에 주어지는 텍스트의 양이 정말 어마어마합니다. 스토리텔링을 좋아하는 유저 입장에서는 너무 좋지만, 텍스트를 읽어가며 시간을 들여서 스토리 흐름을 따라가야 하기 때문에 머리 비우고 액션만 즐기고 싶은 유저에게는 게임 자체를 스킵해버리고 싶을 수도 있습니다.  한 마디로 인스턴트 라면 먹고 싶은 사람에게 진하디 진한 꼬리곰탕을 내밀면서 먹으라는 느낌이겠네요. 저는 개인적으로 극호였습니다만.. 

장단점 외에 다른 이야기를 조금 해보자면.. 

[진정한 위쳐라면 죽행] 
만약 본인이 조금 매콤하게 진행하고 싶다? 최고 난이도인 죽음의 행진으로 플레이하는 걸 강력하게 추천드립니다. 위쳐는 기본적인 검술 외에도 표식과 물약을 쓸 수 있는데 쉬운 난이도에서는 그냥 검만 쓰고 표식은 곁다리로, 물약은 딱히 신경 안 써도 다 깰 수 있습니다. 너무 쉽달까. 하지만 죽행 난이도는 적들이 죽창(?)을 들고 다니기 때문에 쓸 수 있는 거 싸그리 다 써야 합니다. 검술, 표식, 물약을 다 갖춘 진정한(?) 위쳐로 거듭날 수 있습니다 ㅎㅎ 매번 괴물 도감을 잘 살펴보며 효과있는 기름도 꼼꼼히 발라야 생존할 수 있습니다 ㅎㅎ 특히 초반에 엄청 매운데, 중후반 가면서 난이도가 점점 낮아지는 편입니다. 

[다양한 스타일로 플레이 해보자] 
위쳐에는 늑대, 곰, 살쾡이, 바이퍼, 맨티코어 등 다양한 교단이 존재합니다. 위쳐 장비가 아닌 장비들도 착용 가능하지만, 성능과 룩에서 너무나 큰 차이를 보이기 때문에 컨셉 플레이가 아닌 이상 글쎄요. 윗 등급으로 갈수록 장비를 만드는데 엄청난 노력과 돈이 들어가기 때문에 본인 선호하는 스타일과 세트 보너스에 맞춰 1-2개 정해놓고 고것만 쭉쭉 업그레이드하시는게 정신 건강에 좋습니다. 저는 다 만들려고 했다가 돈이 너무 급격하게 빨려서 포기했습니다. 저는 넷플릭스 위쳐에서 헨리 카빌이 입는 잊혀진 늑대 교단과 곰 교단이 가장 멋지달까. 

오랜만에 너무 너무 재밌게 플레이했고 도과를 다 하고 나서도 도과랑 관련 없는 퀘스트도 다 해버린 유일무이한 게임이 아닐까 싶네요 (보통 도과랑 관련 없으면 무시하는게 다반사인데..) 

위쳐3하고 나니 사이버펑크 2077도 해보고 싶다는 생각이 불쑥 듭니다. 1인칭 뷰는 좀 별로라 안 했거든요. 위쳐 4 개발에 들어갔으니 그 동안 다른 걸로 시간이라도 떄워봐야지 ㅠ",2751,647,0.0065430752453653,0.0272628135223555,1,5,0,14,1904,0.0,0.0,1,15,2,4,0.8823529411764706,21,0,0,0,233,435,158.91666666666666,48.016666666666666,158.91666666666666,0,0,0,0,17.31095962244363,0.3021499737808075,0,0.3653256704980843,0.535632183908046,1,1761344414,1761345968,1,1,0,0,0,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811

207478330,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,normal,recent_all,"94/100 A really good RPG.  

Not quite as good as Zelda Breath of the Wild, but a hugely in-depth game with a massive open world chock full of interesting content and quests, cool lore and monsters, and rich progression systems.  

There is some stuff that sucks, like horse riding and horse races, fist fights, the boss fight with Detlaff, playing as Ciri is no fun because she is so weak, the sound regularly not working when the game starts, no controller key for quicksave (long pressing the view button would have worked), and the annoying unnecessary launcher.  

This is definitely a game you should play, but be warned it is a big game. 

If you're playing for the first time then here are some controller shortcuts which are not obvious: long pressing the controller menu button takes you straight into world map, pressing left stick (no need to hold) puts you into run/swim fast mode including when indoors, pressing right stick changes/cycles the active objective when you have a quest active that has multiple simultaneous objectives.",1046,176,0.0124282982791587,0.0181644359464627,0,0,0,5,0,0.0234013605442177,0.4863134484563058,1,1,0,1,1.0,2,0,0,0,120,3674,253.63333333333333,7.3,253.63333333333333,0,0,0,0,4.124063608884216,0.0287817058746221,0,0.0690346579568136,0.0326619488296135,1,1761326247,1761326432,1,1,0,0,0,0,999,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811,9,Overwhelmingly Positive,238322,7811
